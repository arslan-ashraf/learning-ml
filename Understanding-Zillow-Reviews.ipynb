    "My property was off-market for a few months due to a private transaction attempt, but when it was re-listed, Zillow failed to reset the \"days on Zillow\" count. As a result, it appears as though my property has been sitting on the market for over three months when it was actually just listed. This misleading information could seriously impact potential buyers' perceptions and the overall marketability of my property. Despite bringing this issue to Zillow's attention and pointing out how Redfin handles such situations correctly, Zillow's response was dismissive and unhelpful. They simply stated, \"Redfin and Zillow operate independently,\" without any effort to address or correct the error. This kind of snarky response and unwillingness to resolve a clear problem is unacceptable. Zillow's refusal to update the listing date has left me very dissatisfied, and I would caution others to be wary of such issues when using their platform.\n",

    "Zillow is awful and it makes the renting process confusing and frustrating. It feels like a scam when you go to apply and you have to pay Zillow for the personal screening report but then it wouldn't work for the realtor company you go through. It feels like there are no real people to talk to and not everyone has the same life and some of the questions don't fit me but you have to put something. I miss dealing with real people and not these copy and paste answer drones that have no answer and no idea what their job even is. It's like everyone in the offices weren't trained and just tell you to hover over your emails waiting for them to respond when you are in a rush and you end up missing out on a house that would have been perfect for your needs. It's just bad communication all around.\n",

Now if a consumer clicks on that link it will send you to any crappy agent who wants to pay THOUSANDS of dollars per month to receive leads. Same thing with Realtor.com. The National Association of Realtors is totally corrupt and makes us pays hundreds of dollars in dues and then they sell your consumer information and Realtor's personal information to make money off of all of us.\n",
    "Look at a listing, then scroll down to see who the listing agent is and then call them direct. Do not click on \"contact agent\" on any website. There is no criteria to becoming an agent who will sell you your largest financial asset that you own. Consumers, do your research. Also, Zillow Group owns DotLoop. Your agent / Realtor uses DotLoop for your transactions. It is a cloud-based platform for electronic storage and signatures. Realtors are forced to use DotLoop, our brokers make these decisions. Because Zillow owns DotLoop, your private transaction details are not private.\n",

When Zillow acquired Dotloop in 2015, Dotloop offered a privacy guarantee – which stated that Zillow wouldn’t have access to any user data without permission. However, in mid-2020, that changed. Now, you have to opt out of Dotloop data sharing with Zillow. So, by default, Zillow has access to your Dotloop transaction data dating back to 2016. With your transaction data, Zillow can improve their own tools – like Zestimate and advertising.\" Zillow does not care about the consumer.

    "I applied to rent a home through Zillow, used the Zillow online application. Zillow asked me for my Social Security number, date of birth, all personal information, for proof of my income, etc. I applied to rent a home. I paid for Zillow to get my credit score, and it came back at 817 points. I proved I had large income this year due to selling a property, in addition to two other incomes. The rent for the home was about $3,300 a month. I easily qualified. I stated my reason for moving was I want to sell my house and rent a house. The potential landlord came back on me and said I have to sell my house first and pay him one year's rent. His listing says month to month rent, no mention of one year's rent upfront.\n",
    "So, concerned Zillow had given a private party all of my personal information and the landlord changed the rent to yearly rent, one year in advance, I contacted Zillow about it. Zillow came back saying they are keeping the home for rent in Zillow, blamed me for giving out my personal information. I filled out the Zillow application, did what the Zillow application told me to do. I did not personally give anyone my information. Zillow blamed me so it can keep the account, pretended I gave someone my personal information. So, I put in fraud alerts with all three credit reporting agencies and notified both the potential landlord and Zillow that I put in fraud alerts.\n",

    "The problem is Zillow showed a private party, not a rental agency, my credit score, income, etc. and then the private party rejected my application showing like 3 times. The income needed to qualify. So, I see it as potential identity theft situation, and Zillow simply told me not to be giving out my personal information. I would not recommend using Zillow's online rental application as the information goes not only to rental agencies and apartment complexes, it goes to private parties. The only other reason the potential landlord would ask for about $40,000 from me at one time, for a whole year's rent, is he saw I had money and wanted a lot of money at one time. Zillow should have taken his ad down once he went from listing a monthly rental to a year's rent at one time.\n",

    "My experience with Zillow has been a colossal disappointment and a financial drain. After forking out a whopping $580 per month for six long months, I was shocked to find that they still charged me despite canceling just one day before the billing date. Their initial promise of delivering two viable leads per month was enticing, but what they conveniently neglected to disclose was that these \"leads\" could potentially be realtors, FSBOs (For Sale by Owner), or individuals already associated with a Zillow agent. This lack of transparency is profoundly unethical.\n",
    "What's more, Zillow's complete absence of effective filters to sift out fake leads makes the situation even worse. My investment in their service has proven to be an egregious waste of money and an eye-opening lesson in the perils of trusting a company that not only fails to deliver on its promises but also lacks integrity. I advise you to exercise extreme caution when dealing with Zillow and scrutinize where your money is going. Beware.\n",

Zillow thus mislocates the property to somewhere else and gave a very low rent estimate. This negatively affect my customer's rental advertisement.

    "I've been using Zillow for quite some time, and while I appreciate the platform's efforts to help people find the right real estate agents, I'm deeply disappointed by its review policy. Zillow's refusal to publish negative reviews is a major drawback that undermines the credibility of the platform. In my recent experience, I had a less-than-satisfactory interaction with an agent, and I wanted to share my honest feedback with the Zillow community. However, to my surprise, Zillow rejected my negative review because I hadn't formally hired the agent in question. This policy essentially silences the voices of individuals who have had negative experiences with agents, preventing them from warning others about potential pitfalls.\n",
    "Transparency is crucial in the real estate industry, where significant financial decisions are made. Buyers and sellers deserve to have access to a complete picture of an agent's performance, including the good and the bad. Zillow's current review policy only serves to create a biased, overly positive image of agents, which does a disservice to users. I believe that Zillow should reevaluate its review policy and consider allowing reviews from all perspectives involved in a real estate transaction. This would not only enhance the platform's credibility but also empower users to make more informed decisions when selecting an agent. In summary, while Zillow is a valuable resource for the real estate market, its refusal to publish negative reviews is a glaring flaw that needs to be addressed. Let's work toward a more transparent and user-centric review system that benefits everyone in the real estate community.\n",

    "Zillow’s tenant screening services provided through Zillow Rental Manager failed to catch a prior eviction and an extensive criminal history of tenants I rented to. Even the credit score provided was not correct. Lost over $20k in eviction costs and property damage. I live in a unit on the property and had to move out during the eviction process after I was verbally harassed by one of my criminal tenants whose court records showed he served jail time for felony meth possession and had various assault arrests including assault with a deadly weapon. The last threatening words of one of my tenants to me after the eviction: “Buckle up **.” Would not have rented to people like this if Zillow’s inaccurate background check hadn’t given me false green flags regarding my tenants’ credit and criminal history. Expensive and traumatizing experience. My life is forever entwined with unstable felons thanks to Zillow.\n",

Then that person was so rude and hung up on me. I called back, spoke to another person that was also rude and said that they couldn't help me. Zillow only wants to service Listers, and give invalid contact info and no customer service to help. Fraudulent, unethical business!!!!\n",

Instead, I received a call from Zillow trying to hook me up with a buyer's agent.

For example, why do applicants have to have 10 landlords run a credit check on them when they can simply tell the landlords their credit standing and save all the 10 application fees? Also, Zillow.com makes you pay $35 for unlimited amount of rental applications you can submit in a month period. I've done this for 3 months and not one application made it back to me. Why is credit the only criteria for rental denial? This is an evil scheme setup by Rental industry such as Zillow.com where the majority of applicants scramble over their applications in an attempt to get a place to live. In the process, numerous run to credit checks can damage their credits further and waste their fees for the applications they know will get denied anyway based on credit alone - even without eviction record.

My neighbor who maintains nothing around his house who has less land, less square footage (3800) who pays similar taxes, who lived in the same community almost as long as I have so no home sales, has a home valuation of !! $261.00/sq ft. When I called their customer service no one answered, when I wrote and complained I got the ** answer that their algorithm is deciding it. I'm an engineer with masters and a computer/software test professional. If both homeowners have access to the SAME form to describe their home features, if both bought around the same time and pay the same taxes, and if one is much better house with tons of renovations...how come the better home worths almost 30% less in SQ FT. The only explanation to this is intentional manipulation.\n",

    "Potential consumers should give zero credence to Zillow's home value algorithm. It's far from accurate... sometimes being 40% or more inaccurate. For example, my home is valued by Zillow to be 41% less than my neighbor's house, despite my house having over 400 more square feet of living space, twice the garage space, and my house being new (neighbor's house is about 40 years old). The irony is that the County's tax assessment shows my house being valued at 19% MORE than my neighbor's house. Assuming the county's tax assessment is more accurate than Zillow - relative to value comparison - Zillow's estimate for my house is about 41% less than what it should be, assuming my neighbor's house is accurately valued by Zillow. I have contacted Zillow multiple times to get them to re-evaluate home value listings in my neighborhood in light of the discrepancy noted above. Each time, Zillow responds by saying that they stand behind their algorithm - even when there is obvious flaws - and they have done zero investigations. Don't trust Zillow!\n",

    "First & worst experience with Sado ** at Zillow. Let’s begin with the fact that he does not answer the phone, I’ve called numerous times during the Refinancing process & not once has he picked up the phone, I can only get through to him when he needs information from me. Sado was extremely confident with the appraisal being waived. Here is a text directly from Sado regarding the appraisal, \"Ok so No Cash to Close, not a penny out of pocket. We're paying off/consolidating the Mortgage and the Main Student Loan of 33k. All in all about 671 as your new Mortgage Payment going forward. All the while, no appraisal needed.\"\n",
    "A couple days later it seemed that we needed an appraisal ordered after he stated that it wasn’t needed. He told me that Zillow would waive the $500 appraisal fee. The appraiser popped in & within 2 hours of the appraiser leaving (on a Saturday) I received an email from Sado with the revised docs with a higher estimated payment. My question is how can docs be revised if the appraisal report wasn’t even in yet, I mean the appraiser just left & within 2 hours I get an email with revised docs. I attempted to call Sado several times afterwards & again he Never answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was fed up & switched to another financing company called Octane which gave me a better interest rate & most importantly answers the phone when I call. I proceeded with Octane & terminated the relationship with Zillow. A week later they sent me an email with a $500 appraisal charge. I called Sado (of course no answer). He then texts me apologizing for being busy. I explained why I’m terminating the relationship with Zillow & he then told me that Zillow was only going to roll the Appraisal into the loan when he clearly stated the appraisal would be waived. Sado doesn’t seem to communicate well at all! Telling someone that Zillow would eat the appraisal fee then say it was only going to be rolled into the loan so I wouldn’t need cash to close has deception & scam written all over it. Dalisha **, the underwriter at Zillow also assured me that the appraisal fee was waived. She is another one that does not answer the phone under any circumstances!\n",

    "I will never again use Zillow for anything in the future. Everything mentioned here is exactly what occurred. I have the entire text thread as evidence yet Zillow keeps denying my review & tells me I should alter it. Zillow, please state which part you find illegal & if it is regarding an appraisal waiver attempt then Sado is guilty. How is it logic for my review to be flagged when this is exactly what happened! If this review isn’t posted I’ll be taking legal action against zillow!\n",

    "The only reason I put one star - there is no negative stars. This is a big scheme. Our office is a real estate office. They talked us into purchasing the leads. Few years back it was making sense. But now.... First of all they lie about market share that you are buying. When we decided to spend $1,000 per month they said that we were buying 30% of market share for a given zip code. So, we were getting some calls until everything came to a halt. We called our rep and he said that we don't have 30% anymore. They said that somebody purchased more. But there was an opportunity to buy more market share and they talked us into spending $1,600/month for 54% of market share. This was automatically putting us into position #1.\n",
    "Well, few months later our name disappeared again. We called in with the questions and we were told that this market is no longer at 100%. Now it was guaranteed 3 slots at 100% each. After few more sales pitches they talked us into purchasing 70% of market share for $3,200 per month. Few months later our name is again nowhere to be found! So, we called again and this time we are told that this zip code is outperforming and they \"ADDED MORE INVENTORY (?????)\" and if we wanted to still have our market share/presence we would need to add another $3,000 in addition to $3,200 per month.\n",

    "Well first of all this is constantly changing rules game/pyramid.

They schedule it 3 days before closing (because that’s where they could fit it in, keep in mind closing had been scheduled for 5 weeks at this point). They emailed us the afternoon before the walkthrough that if we aren’t completely out of the house by the walkthrough they would hold back $5000.00 the day of closing. There was no way for us with that short of notice to move up the movers. Here we are the night of closing (my husband and I signed our part of the documents at 9 am) and the deed hasn’t been recorded and we have received no money. BEWARE.\n",

    "HOW ZILLOW NOW SOCKS IT TO THE HOME SELLER (without a realtor)- FSBO\n",
    "From Zillow\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Moreover, earlier this year, we added new options to sort listings on Zillow. Listings are filtered into two categories: ‘Agent Listings’ and ‘Other Listings. You can easily toggle back and forth to find great homes in each category.\"\n",

I research homes for sale all the time and missed that extra step completely, as it does for most others. By not even showing my home is for sale in the satellite roof top view, everyone thinks nothing more is for sale on my block with a realtor’s listing next door. If only the realtors know to look for the FSBO sellers grouped together, like shooting fish in a barrels, separately, and apart, then I understand why. I have zero response from my advertised open house last week, and multiple calls from agents fishing for a listing. It all looks like an intentional concept to support complaints from realtors having to find or contend with FSBO’S at the expense of the FSBO (home owner). You must now be excluded from the Open House listing and forced to hit a button tagged other listing to see your open house ad.\n",

I got a call from Kyle, who was a great guy to deal with and very responsive throughout the entire process. Everyone that I dealt with was very pleasant and helpful. They sent someone to do the physical inspection and and sent me a revised offer. Somehow the person who did the inspection lost about 600 sq ft of our house and hence reducing the value by $18100. Honestly I was still ok with the offer so we signed the contract. They were very understanding and flexible with closing date. We closed on time and everything went smooth and I would sell a house through Zillow again if the need arises. I did try other sites too but I found Zillow to be the easiest one to do business with.

    "A couple of weeks ago I found out that I can sell my home to Zillow, and they have a program that will allow me to purchase a new home through them, and do this as an \"all-in-one\"! Amazing! They call this Zillow 360. Well, the program sounds amazing in theory. What they should've called it was \"Zillow Wasteyourtime\". After getting a preliminary idea of what they would offer me I signed up for more info on the program, and was contacted very quickly by someone, and urged to setup an evaluation on my home (this is how you find an actual amount that Zillow will pay you for your home). I made an appointment online for a date 11 days out. No problem. I sent an E-Mail with questions to the agent who had contacted me, and this is where the issues began.\n",

She asked me if I would like \"Zillow Home Loans\" to reach out to me, a day AFTER saying that she would request it already. Then once Zillow Home Loans (ZHL) contacted me, it only got worse. I got mixed information from the loan officer and his assistant about his availability. After a few days of E-Mails and questions we scheduled a call. He called me an hour late, in the middle of dinner. We scheduled a second call, he called an hour EARLY this time and left a voicemail saying he would be busy at the appointment time and he would call 30-60 minutes after it. He never did. Despite this I still scheduled a third appointment with him, and this time he called almost TWO hours late.\n",

A lot of the houses are out of date and they don't have enough filtering options. But it's fast and I like the lay out. After this, however, I will be using realtor.com for my house hunting and zillow can miss out on the money they would've pocketed by having me as a customer.\n",

The only change they had was the Earnest money had to be submitted to the Zillow attorney and not per the original offer. My real estate agent asked them to submit the information and I would forward the Earnest money. The next day, my agent called back and asked them to submit the ACH information so we could proceed with the sale. Again, Zillow confirmed with my agent verbally and via email that the offer was accepted and I would have the information the following Monday.\n",

I asked for a refund and they declined. I asked my CC to get my refund and they said I didn't fill out the cancel my account on their form. What form, last zip code I canceled Ryan refunded it with a text. This is definitely a scam internet company who needs to be shut down and I will make sure they are. 692.00 for one month of no referrals. I am a struggling new agent; shame on them.\n",

    "I am a California Licensed Broker and have compared Zillow's \"Zestimates\" to real world MLS comps. Zillow is typically way off. For my own house they say it's market value is approximately 50% of actual value. Their algorithms don't seem to have the ability to take into account similar properties, square footage, views, garage space, etc. On a property I manage, Zillow's \"Zestimate\" is approximately 20% higher than actual sales. I have submitted actual data to them twice. It's ignored. My opinion is Zillow's \"Zestimates\" are a joke!\n",

I really liked the home, not only that she sent in the contract late going for $ 214,500. My banker told her we will give you 221,500 and that will cover the closing cost and my maximum offer was $250,000 and still lost the home!!!\n",

    "I tried the Zillow application option, where I pay them and they pull your credit and background to make applying easy. A waste of money, owners don't view them even when they have the option to apply. Save your money and go straight to the renter agent. They all charged their own fees. Even the one (only one mind you) that opened the application contacted me to pay for their separate fees. A big money grab scam. I hope this at least saves someone else the trouble. I couldn't get a refund from Zillow so now I am going to my bank to try and get refund for misrepresentation.\n",

Zillow then added a walkthrough video from the old agent that sold us the house with his phone number on it. They never called me back. I called six times to tell them to remove it. They still have not taken my ad down off their site. I have no chance on selling my house because it doesn't look anything like that old video. Zillow used to be for the homeowner now they just try to forward your house to a broker in any way shape or form that they can. Do not sell by for sale by owner on Zillow!!!!\n",

I do like that Zillow gives you actual price history and shows the amount of cuts/increases over time as compared to Redfin, but it's weird that the value of the house over time as a chart includes prices listed by owners, even if the list price was later changed.

I liked that I could put in my own filters. It definitely cut down on wasted time swiping through homes that I shouldn't even be looking at. It was also extremely helpful that it provides full information on all homes. I do admit though that there were times when the description section did not match the fact section. Also the photo quality on some of the homes was lacking. There were also times when hardly or NO photos were given. A big disappointment was a lack of floor plans and room measures on all homes by brand new.\n",

They did not respond to a complaint directly through their system. A house in the neighborhood just sold which is almost identical to mine for well beyond what they paid originally 6 years ago. So there is no rhyme or reason. It’s frustrating to an owner and to neighbors. They should not be allowed to post just irregularities.

    "Zillow provides two services:\n",
    "1. Free home search tools to homebuyers\n",
    "2. Paid lead generation for real estate agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of the reviews on this site clearly are from the former group, reviewing the latter group. But they're just rating the excellent agents that are not affiliated with Zillow, outside of paying Zillow for those leads. The issue is, the paid lead generation (aka Zillow Premier Agent), in our experience, is a HORRIBLE service for real estate agents like ourselves, and Zillow itself treats its paying customers (at least us and many other agents we've spoken to) terribly. So the ratings on this site are deceivingly positive, when the truth is that Zillow itself is destroying the livelihood of agents like us by not being upfront about their lead generation service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We invested over $36,000 into Zillow lead generation and got nothing for it. Only after being locked into a contract for 6 months, did we find out that LEADS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE. Agents, read that again. The leads you PAY FOR (in SoCal they're often $800+ per lead) are NOT exclusive to you. You have 30 days to get the lead to proactively opt-in to an exclusivity agreement with you—if they don't respond or decline the invite, they go back into the pool for other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we all know, leads are often unresponsive in the beginning, so this system is designed for failure. This allows Zillow to make money on the same lead sent to multiple paying advertisers. I don't know about you, but if I had known that upfront I NEVER would have signed up. The contract doesn't mention this anywhere, neither does the sales representative. Neither does the website training documents, or the onboarding manuals/conversations you have with your account rep. You are left to figure this hindrance out for yourself, and once you do, they refuse to let you out of your contract for any reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of this, the majority of the \"leads\" you get are people who think you're either a Zillow employee, or the listing agent. They very often already have agents representing them, and are just calling for info on the property, not because they're interested in hiring a buyer's agent. So you're paying hundreds of dollars to talk to waste-of-time tire kickers with absolutely no intention of ever using you. In a response to my BBB complaint, Zillow claimed \"We provide agent-ready buyer leads to local real estate agents and in that process, these leads remain exclusive to the agent we connect them with.\" This is objectively false on several accounts. The leads are not agent-ready, as explained above, and they're not exclusive!\n",
    "\n",
    "In my opinion, Zillow is destroying the real estate industry through deceptive practices. It's ironic, since Zillow can attribute its success directly to the realtors from whom it originally \"borrowed\" the MLS listings that realtors have to pay for the privilege to post to. Now, Zillow is opening its own brokerage, literally stepping on the heads of the industry professionals they used to get to where they are in the process. This company, in my opinion, does NOT have agents' best interests at heart, and in fact deceives them with false promises and lack of transparency relating to the severe limitations voluntarily implemented by them in their own system. Let this be a stern warning to any other agent thinking of investing, you could easily end up like me—out almost $40k with nothing to show for it.\n",

    "Updated on 03/02/2021: Zillow is a loosely built, poorly designed and horribly maintained website that has no criteria for posting properties, screening real estate agents, checking for the validity of information or correcting major errors. I have tried for over a year to find a waterfront, vacant lot property in northern Michigan, Northern Minnesota or Northern Wisconsin. All of these areas have literally thousands of waterfront properties for sale but you will not be able to find one, learn FACTS about the property, find a WILLING agent to represent you or buy one. Why? Reread the first sentence above. At least one third, and probably closer to one half, of the properties they emailed me are NOT WATERFRONT PROPERTIES.\n",
    "I provided them with feedback on DOZENS of their errors and the errors were NEVER corrected and their search engines got worse and not better. They did not care. Eventually, more than half of their postings had so little information that I was FORCED to push the \"contact an agent\" icon to put up with numerous calls from, texts from and emails from agents who had NEVER seen the property, were unsure where it was, were not interested finding information about the property or providing assistance of any kind. I was not looking for a home or a huge tract of land for which the sale would make them thousands of dollars for doing little if anything so they were not interested. I reported these to Zillow and surprise, they did NOTHING.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would a Realtor let a website put their contact information on their website if they had no intention of trying to sell it? Many of them have other jobs or are stay at home couch potatoes who are not Realtors is my guess. Several of them had no knowledge of standard Real Estate practices. Since my search was not limited to one area, so I could not find and hire a LICENSED REALTOR who belongs to the National Association of Realtors (NAR) to do a MLS search and send me the MLS listings. When it became clear that I was going to have to drive up there with my camping trailer next summer and look for a property by myself, I decided to go to Mexico next winter and see what I can find along the Baja coast.\n",

    "If you choose to have an account with Zillow.com, you will be supporting this scam of a business and become part of the problem. If we can kill Zillow and their website, a real business could enter the market and provide real services for a small monthly fee that would actually help you rather than increase your frustration level to a 10+. Out-of-control Capitalism is killing this country and by allowing companies like this to stay in business we are complicit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Review: I've been looking for a small acreage on a waterfront in a far away state. I find that Zillow is not well organized and not motivated to assist buyers. Zillow allows properties to be listed with very little information and/or incorrect information forcing potential buyers to contact one of Zillow's listed agents who often know little or nothing about the properties or the sellers. These agents refuse to answer any questions that I ask in my initial contact email forcing me to either ignore them and look elsewhere or talk to them on the phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the phone I get sketchy answers at best (as noted, they often have never seen the property or seen a real MLS listing). These agents want to provide a Zoom or FaceTime \"showing,\" without ever answering your question(s). If you have unlimited time to entertain these agents going through three or four \"showings\" every weekend, good for you. I do not have unlimited time. I want the agents to answer my questions to see if the property fits my criteria BEFORE wasting my time with the agent's hard sell \"showing.\" It is impossible to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have given Zillow more than a dozen complaints about the horrible listings they allow. Not one has been changed. My saved searches always contain the \"waterfront\" criteria. About a third of the properties Zillow sends to me are not on a waterfront. I get to waste my time going to the Zillow website trying to determine if the property has this deal breaker criteria. Apparently, Zillow is in business for real estate agents but I cannot see how either Zillow or the agents to whom they cater actually make sales. Their horrible customer service is off putting at best and almost always crazy making.\n",

    "I purchased a home in May of this year listed on Zillow. From word go, it was awful. Had to negotiate for all kinds of things left undone. The worst is not connecting the microwave vent hood to the outside. Closing would have been a nightmare but my agent saved the day. Zillow has no office in Houston to serve clients. You have to take a stack of about 100 sheets that you print yourself to a notary, have them notarized, scan them in and send the paper copy in to them. They will not accept a check at closing, it has to be electronic transfer. After closing, I was not given a key to the mailbox or a garage door opener. I had to purchase a closer and program. The key was obtained by going to the post office and requesting a new key which required installing a new lock. If a house is listed on Zillow run as fast as you can.\n",

    "We listed our home For Sale By Owner on Zillow. Shortly after we decided to use a realtor and he said we would need to deactivate our Zillow listing. Zillow refuses to deactivate it. The MLS photos do not appear because Zillow will not let me, the owner, delete my For Sale By Owner listing. When I try to deactivate/delete the listing a message appears that says, this listing is now on the MLS and can only be controlled by the realtor. The realtor is unable to delete the pictures that I had uploaded because they were placed by owner. The realtor has our new pictures viewable through the MLS and any other site.\n",
    "After 30 days of requests Zillow still refuses to correct the situation. There is no phone number to call. There is a corporate number that directs you to a voicemail but it is VRS and goes to a full mailbox. Really? Zillow cannot afford to staff a live person or empty their voicemail to legitimately take calls? They can't correct a situation after 30 days? I am told by my realtor that in the fine print Zillow uses a persons ad even after the listing is deactivated for advertising. I just want the listing corrected. I do not have any confidence in the Zillow system, their Zestimate or any of their products.\n",

    "Zillow Offers is a scam. I only write this review to help others avoid my $27,500 mistake trusting this scam artist. On 8/15/2019 I asked Zillow for an offer on my house. I needed to sell my house fast because I found anther house I wanted to buy and did not want to loose it. It was a great deal and was bank owned. On 9/26/19 I finally received my offer. The offer was very low but I still wanted to close on the other house. On 10/13/2019 there was an appointment to go over the offer and how someone to look over the house.\n",
    "On 10/15/2019 they made a final offer marking down anything they found wrong with the house. This could anything from wall plate not matching in color to them wanting to rip out my brand new expensive carpet that I just installed and installing cheap carpet instead. The reality is they are just trying to get the house as cheap as they can. On 10/31/2019 I wrote Zillow to explain some of the crazy items they wanted to change. For example taking out built-ins and replace all outlet switches. They wrote back to me on the same day saying they would get back to me..\n",
    "\n",
    "After trying every few days by phone to get ahold of them I wrote a email asking for a update on 11/18/19. On 11/19/2019 I wrote them again begging them to get back to me on I will loose the house I wanted and my NON-REFUNDABLE deposit of $22,365 (My life savings). I only did this because Zillow was supposed to be a sure thing. Later in the day they got back to me saying they should know more information by 4pm. The next day, 11/20/2019 I wrote them at 9:50am and 5:14pm saying I have not heard anything back.\n",
    "\n",
    "On 11/22/19. I finally heard from Zillow. They will not reduce any of the fixing they wanted to charge me. (Taking out built-ins, Changing all light switches, that are all in great condition, for example). At this point I had no choice but to take the offer as is or lose my deposit and my dream home. I wrote them back and said fine. One hour passed and they said because of the time has passed we will have to start all over again. Explained the problem to them and said how fast can we get this done.\n",
    "\n",
    "End of day 11/22/19. They wrote me one last time saying they just changed what homes they are buying and my home is too large for them. They are no longer going to buy my home. I was forced to sell my home on a fire sale with the MLS or lose the dream home and my deposit for the home. In the end I sold the home 30,000 less than Zillow’s final offer because they backed out. I also had to pay a realtor about $30,875 to sell it. If I would have just sold it on the MLS from the beginning I would have had the time to do a lot better instead of trying to use Zillow and having them shift the price they were going to give us and ultimately backing out of the deal costing me $68,875.\n",

    "If you're considering a home purchase from Zillow -- BEWARE! I purchased my home, and while the initial impressions and cosmetic details were nice, there have been a plethora of major underlying problems. Zillow sold me a \"lemon\", and due to their \"methods\" of skirting around disclosure statements, many preexisting problems with the home were disguised and did not become evident until after I moved in. To name a few: HVAC system failure, almost all cabinetry required replacement slides and hinges, a plumbing leak was \"hidden\" because shutoff valve upstream had been closed. Almost all ceiling fans are extremely out of balance and will likely require replacement. A multitude of other problems have begun to show up, and in short, these issues have cost me a small fortune that I was not anticpating upon moving into a relatively new, supposedly \"turn-key\" home.\n",
    "Furthermore, their real estate agent invalidated my initial closing by not filling out the paperwork appropriately. This delayed my move-in approximately 2 weeks, and required significant extra work for my family and I to adjust insurance, utilities, and re-sign all paperwork. This has been a truly horrific experience since the initial closing. I strongly caution anyone against buying a house sold by Zillow.\n",

We did not know that. I have written Zillow 3 times to remove our home from their site as it is not for sale now. The first time I contacted them the price listed for our home was 294,000. Three days after contacting them the price dropped 20,000 to 274,000. I again contacted them by providing everything they asked for, stating, I want my home removed from your site and explained what had happened with the price plunge.

I am anxious for the class action suit Zillow has rightfully earned from despicable practices using private property as a pawn to do as they wish with no matter the cost to the actual owner. Redfin removed our property after being contacted one time and did not devaluate as a result. Please stay away from Zillow. They think they untouchable and treat you the same way.

I was very happy with the service. Fast forward to about a year ago. The lead quality fell off a cliff and I received nearly zero leads most months, whether I paid $50/month or over $300/month. When I did receive a lead, the quality was awful and I have not converted a single one to a sale. Twice in the last six months I was charged for lead \"Connections\", that's when Zillow connects a waiting telephone hot lead directly to you, however, both times the line was dead. When I complained, I was told, basically, 'Well, you're not spending enough and you're not worth our time.' I do not recommend zillow. In spending over $1,000 in the last 12 months for their advertising, I received almost nothing in return and closed nothing on the pathetic scraps that were tossed to me.\n",

    "Zillow appears to inaccurately estimate some home values based on old comps and using select lower priced closings and not all comps. For example they have used homes with no updating, no pool and no solar and given those higher values than our house with extensive updating and an owned 9.3 kw solar worth $$$$. (Wow sellers no need to spend thousands updating your home as Zillow gives that zero Or little value.) Some of our comps used by Zillow closed years ago. They can not say we don’t have recent comps as we do but they only used the lower priced homes and many with little or no updating.\n",
    "They also have every home on our block with similar square footage valued tens of thousands Higher than ours even though some are not updated or remodeled. There are in fact three homes in our neighborhood which have closed within the last six to seven months which should easily put our homes value between 375000 and 400000 yet they have the Zestimate valued at 338000? They did not use those comps why? This is very inaccurate and should Not be considered as anything other than outdated and inaccurate. I am frustrated and dissatisfied that a company that wants legitimacy in the real estate market is and can be so inaccurate. Please improve your software Zillow. I’m sure all of my neighbors with original 1980/1990 homes appreciate your Zestimate.\n",

I am not sure how or why anyone would want to rely on an algorithm to lookup property information, property values, etc. when an algorithm is flawed and not even a true estimate. I have requested to have my property information removed from their database as it is inaccurate and there is no way for me to accurately correct it, being that it is based on a flawed algorithm.\n",

It is using data from when the property is previous listed with another brokerage. I have updated the property and relisted. Due to this error my property is last in the area and is not populating as a new listing. Zillow is not answering calls or emails and using the coronavirus as the reason. A phone call or email can be done remotely. Zillow also owns Trulia which is the second most viewed site for home buyers. My listing is not getting the proper exposure and I am at Zillow's mercy until they decide to answer customers. Highly Frustrating.\n",

    "Zillow signed a contract to purchase my rental house in Phoenix. I had tenants in the house and, as per the contract, had to let them go before the closing date. However, 9 days before the closing, Zillow cancelled the contract due to Coronavirus (although, there was no such clause in the contract). As a result, not only that the house won't be sold and I wasted countless hours in the closing process, more importantly, I lost steady rent revenue which I counted on to help me pay mortgage, property taxes, insurance..., and it's almost impossible to find a new tenant in this pandemic situation.\n",
    "To make the matter worse, I live in New York City, which is the hardest stricken part of the US by the pandemic, and there is a real possibility that I may lose my job (not to mention sick or worse) as countless of New Yorkers already did. Because of that, I may lose my ability to pay mortgage and end up in the streets, especially now that I cannot count on the rent revenue. Zillow did offer $5k in earnest money, however, in my situation is not enough, as it may prolong the bad outcome for only a few months. Zillow made my already difficult situation immeasurably worse\n",

    "We were sent an email two weeks before we were set to close that Zillow was halting the purchases of homes because of the COVID-19 virus. We were also supposed to close on a new home the same day. So two families were impacted as they had moved out of their home. We were offered two solutions, 5K for inconvenience, or they will list our home for free which makes no sense. This has hit our families in a major way.\n",
    "This is the email that I sent: Please let me know the status of this escalation. Per our convo, we were set to close with Zillow and a new home on April 9th. The sellers of the home that we had plans to purchase have moved out, made ALL of the improvements that we requested, and trusted not only us, but that Zillow was also purchasing our home. I don't understand how Zillow believes that this is good business practice to terminate SO CLOSE to the date that we are supposed to close. This not only impacts my family, but the seller's family, and it's a major financial impact. If this is a matter of health issues, papers can be signed easily, virtually.\n",

    "My bank and Zillow website appraise my home in Littleton Co. at $450 thousand. The Zillow cash offer only $363 thousand, after lowball offer minus fake repair bills. Then, we notice their \"inspection team\" which is nothing more than some young fellow dumping rocks on our back deck, taking photos of that. Tracking in mud on his shoes on the carpet, and taking photos of that. You get the idea. Then we get handed a fake repair bill of 16 thousand dollars. They wanted 8 grand to replace the roof, and the roof is only 2 years old. They wanted 4 grand to replace the furnace, and this furnace is only 19 years old. The rest of the repair bill minor cosmetic stuff.\n",
    "Now we explain the real story. The offer of $362 thousand is the number Zillow starts with, if they believe this is what they would have to pay if this house would go to auction. We got the Same Number from RedFinNow, so this is no coincidence. After speaking with my lender, experts agree the auction value of this property, actually closer to 390 thousand. But Zillow sets their offer number of 362 thousand first, does the fake inspection, then they come up with fake repair bill of 16 thousand, then adds their 7% mark-up fee, plus other fees to arrive at $405 thousand. Then, Zillow said, \"But our offer is 405 thousand, not 363 thousand.\" You kind of see how they try to play you for a fool...\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zillow offer is so low, we can list this home for 411 thousand. We can still advertise the asking price about 40 thousand under market value, turn a sale inside of a few weeks, and then just call it a day. We strongly advise everyone stay away from Zillow, RedFinNOw, any other cash-offer companies. Maybe zero sales and zero profits will help put these people out of business...\n",

    "We looked into selling our house to Zillow. Most of the reviews said they draw you in with a reasonable first offer then after their inspection and repair estimates they adjust their offer to a ridiculously low number. That was exactly our experience. They first offered us 190k for our house but I knew it would be lower than that after they inspected it. I figured based on what I know about the repairs we need and their cost, the lowest they could possibly go would be 172k. And that was in an absolute case scenario. Well, they came back with an offer of 158k. Their inspection came back with the absolutely most insane repair requests. They listed things like \"fix the pool heater.\" We don't even have a pool heater! They said \"remove the pet door in the garage.\" We don't have a pet door!\n",
    "They wanted to charge us to remove the popcorn ceiling in half the house. (We already removed it in the front room, dinning, room, and entry.) And they wanted to install a stone veneer in the backyard. That's just a few of the ridiculous things they used to justify taking more money from our house. The list goes on. And the costs they listed to make any actual repair was WAY above the market cost. So, they clearly were wanting to pocket some extra cash by calling it \"repair.\" Stay far away from Zillow. Get a realtor and sell your house \"as-is\" if you don't feeling like making repairs. Zillow is a terrible way to go.\n",

The only difference is an easement, which is accounted for in the property tax statements, that are also identical. They sold within a week of each other, mine sold for a small bit more because of a tiny bit more privacy, and more usable outdoor space, yet Zillow shows that house having a $85k greater value. There clearly has to be an error in their methodology, so I wrote to tell them.\n",

That too they posted the pictures of the inside of the house. It is not fair to people who are genuinely searching for a house.

    "The process to sell the house with Zillow seemed simple and straightforward. The staff was courteous and professional. The original offer was fair. Their gimmick is over-inflating and making up adjustments after their inspection to justify reducing your original offer, in my case by more than $20K. My house, while used is in mint condition and was purchased only 6 months ago. During our very thorough inspection of about 6 hours prior to purchase, we asked for no adjustments as the house was already in good condition. Since then, we then added a few upgrades and painted the entire house inside in a very nice light grey. Now Zillow comes in and claims about $20K+ of frivolous adjustments which included \"Interior Paint\", \"Replace Doorbell\", the house has a brand new Ring System and \"Replacing the Carpet\" which we have none in any part of the house. These among many others that were ridiculous. Don't waste your time!\n",

Said 3rd party uses tax records, not on my property, they are off by $450,000. Told me they are updated regularly, mine has been wrong for 2 years.

    "I wrote a negative review about a buyers agent to be posted on Zillow.com. The buyers agent scheduled a showing via the Showing Time App, and was a no-show. Zillow \"rejected\" the review even though it was factual and it contained my opinion on the agent. The text: \"We have blacklisted. She is no longer welcome to show our home. She made a showing request as a buyer's agent via ShowTime on Dec 6, and was a no-show. For each no-show, we spend 45-60 minutes straightening up and cleaning. By not showing up, wasted our time. Don't let her waste yours. We recommend that you find a different agent.\" If you look at the pattern of reviews on Zillow, the number of \"5\"s vs 1-4s suggest a widespread suppression of negative reviews. Don't count on Zillow for unbiased, accurate reviews.\n",

    "The process of selling was pain free but we were nickeled and dimed to death. Over $20k in fees and another $20k reduction for upgrades they said the condo would need. Ok, it get it, don't like it but I get it. The part that I hated with a passion was the $500 we were charged for not removing the trash from the curb when we told the agent we were at the mercy of the county. We placed the trash at the curb and contacted the county for pickup. They came 2 days after we called but the Zillow agent couldn't wait and deducted $500 from the final payment to us even after we told her many times the county was coming to get the trash.\n",

That would be normal. But in my case. ONLY my home dropped in value, NOT any of my neighbors', whose homes are same age and same or smaller in size.

This is abusive and shameful in that some buyers will not understand the document and sign. I had nothing against Zillow until going over their addenda.

    "I have been trying to find a home on Zillow for three months. During that time, I have encountered apartment complexes that don't have any apartments available; property managers that do not respond; and then there are those that do respond but do not show up at the designated time. To make matters worse, I have confirmation emails and texts from who I believe are legitimate responses, only to find out that they were not legitimate. This is most disheartening as I have taken off countless hours from work during this time, only for it to be a waste of time.\n",

    "At one point in time I used Zillow to shop homes as it seemed easy to view pics and facts on a home. After going through the home sale process, I realized how inaccurate the Zestimate actually is. I noticed a number of things wrong with the Zillow listing and attempted to update. Unfortunately, you cannot change the neighborhood Zillow has your home associated with when comparing to other home values. When I reached out to Zillow re the value being way off and noticing they were reporting the home in the wrong neighborhood, they asked me to provide them with an official map showing the neighborhood boundary lines. I sent them my county's official website, which states clearly with our property parcel id# the neighborhood we are in and pay taxes based on. I sent a link with the interactive map that shows our home satellite view.\n",
    "They said they needed a map that would show only the neighborhood boundary line as I am thinking they were too lazy to go into each property in the area to see where the neighborhood boundary is located. I then asked them where they get their information since they clearly are using the wrong information. This was their response - \"We receive mapping and neighborhood information through a third party data provider. Legally, we are unable to disclose any information about these companies. The information is taken from Census and county information.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "That is a straight up blatant lie when the county is the one that shows the correct neighborhood, all of our closing documents, etc. There is really no doubt of the neighborhood we are in, only when it comes to Zillow. I had Googled out neighborhood and it showed and outlined area on a Google map of our neighborhood. I guess Google is not a third party they work with as they said they cannot use a map that was found by a web search! Yet they refuse to use the government county website.\n",
    "\n",
    "What all this comes down to is how our home has a Zestimate of $50-60k less than other similar homes. Our home is even newer (30-40 yrs newer) and of block construction, which in Florida is a good thing (whereas a few other with much higher values are wood frame). I brought this to the attention of a Zillow help team member, in which there is apparently only one person. I have reached out several times through different methods and get the same Brandon guy. As others have stated, they are supposedly not able to change the algorithm and it is also mentioned as being so complicated that no one really knows how it measures value. Our home went from $250k range, to 260K range, to $310k, back to $270k and then bounced back and forth every 5 days to a week from $260k to just over $300k for about a month, until it ultimately went back to $250k.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I asked him how it bounces around (and keep in mind, it does not show any of the higher values in the Zestimate history, only the lower) he said it takes time to adjust and this fluctuation was normal. And our listing agent basically told us Zillow was sabotaging our home sale and she had never seen such drastic fluctuations. She also said too many people rely on Zestimate and the value jumping would concern many. He never did answer me why the zestimate history never showed the value over $300k. I took a screenshot to send him as other than that you have no proof the property ever was at that value. As it sits, we are under contact at a value of $50k over the Zillow and we started at close to $75k over the zestimate. I can't help but to think we were hurt and lost out on thousands because of Zillow's careless and fraudulent evaluation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "What was even more frustrating is that other homes that had less bedrooms, much older, inferior construction, off busy roads, and not updated at all (where as our was all updated within the last 5 years other than the roof) were given values at $30-60k above ours. I would gladly join a class action lawsuit as this has turned into a very poor misrepresenting service that puts out false information to people. Unfortunately you cannot block it either as I requested to them....\"if you cannot give a fair or accurate evaluation of our property, please simply block the zestimate out.\" They told me they could not do that either. In culmination, I cannot recommend Zillow for much of anything. May be looking at pics, but any fact on a home must be scrubbed by cross checking with county websites and other consumer sites. At that point, you might as well just use another site altogether.\n",

    "We submitted our house for a Zillow.com offer. They lied about what they look for. They told us not to clean up that it was fine. Their appraiser took pictures of dirty cabinets and said that they needed to be painted/refaced, when they only needed to be wiped down. Their guy lied to my husbands face about what he was looking for. Then on the offer he claimed the same things needed to be fixed over and over in his \"Report\". They wanted to replace all of our floors because they don't match, but it is the type of bamboo flooring. They told us they were only looking at the working order of the house to make sure it was functioning, and then they put in their estimate that they wanted to replace our brand new water heater and pan. The water heater was replaced last year with a brand new one. The pan is new as well.\n",
    "He put remove/replace carpet, when we have NO carpet in our house whatsoever. Then he put remove hardwood floors, which happen to be floating, for the whole house. Then he put demo shelving when they are hung up like pictures, and leaving when we do. On top of all of that, he put to demo our personal items in the backyard, as if we would leave them. To top it all off, he told us we need to secure our toilets, which are bolted to the floor. I am a little confused. If you want to get a real offer, do not use Zillow. They sent out a joke of an appraiser, who needs to get his head examined. And proceeded to tell us that they wanted an 8.2% fee, which they followed up with a ridiculous repair cost.\n",

If the work had been done aboveboard or done correctly we would have been moved in already.\n",
    "They are not responsive to our teams communications, they leave us hanging for a week at a time.

Serious case of horse before the cart. Our realtor sends them a request / communication on a Monday and they don’t reply until Friday, the day we were meant to close... 3 times now. Yes that’s right, 3 times we were supposed to close and the work hadn’t even been moved on. Walls missing, the repairs and replacements not done.

Water damage should be checked nearest to the floor. Anyone worth their salt in construction knows that. At this point I can’t tell if they are being shady or really just don’t know what they are doing. I love the house but if I’d known that we would still be doing this months after starting the process, we would have purchased somewhere else. They have turned what could have been a wonderful and exciting endeavor into something incredibly stressful and dirty. Zillow; great app but horrible realtors.\n",

    "Zillow recently changed their algorithm for making their estimates, and with my home and several others I saw there is a significant error in it and after weeks of trying to deal with very poor customer service I cannot seem to get it corrected. In one day when they instituted this new algorithm the estimate dropped by almost 50%, making it inconsistent with not only the other companies but their own previous estimate. Not only that but more shocking, they put in a completely made up previous sales price and date that must belong to another home because the date was a year after I bought it (and haven't sold it since) and a price more than 75k less than I paid. Looking at the graph of estimates says it all with this marked one day drop. And it's not just my home. Redfin's current estimate is 600-640k. According to my agent even that is low. But zillow's is now 388k, when a day before they put in this new algorithm it was also in the 600k range.\n",
    "I purchased the home in 2015 for 455k with prices rising steadily since then so even common sense tells me there is a problem. it took the customer service person almost 2 weeks just to go to county records to verify what I told her about the previous sales date and price being incorrect. When I informed her that didn't fix the estimate she said (rudely) my report had been sent to the appropriate dept and I would hear from them. Now weeks have passed, the estimate hasn't been corrected, I have not been contacted by anyone, and the correct previous sales price and date have not been added. After several weeks of hearing nothing I contacted the customer service person again and got and got another snippy response. I guess the reason for posting this review is to warn people don't use or believe zillow's estimates and data, and don't expect help from customer service.\n",

    "We put our \"for sale by owner\" house on Zillow. It had inaccurate information from before we bought it, and when we made the corrections and added the upgrades we had done, Zillow changed the estimate to $374,000 - which is just about correct for the market and the house - 2100 sq ft with 550 sq ft garage/shop, .23 acre property, fenced back yard, hat pump, brand new kitchen (studs out remodel,) 5 bedrooms, 2 baths, 14 ft beamed ceilings in living room, with cathedral windows, all double pane windows, wood floors, wood walls - NOT panelling, walking distance to schools, quiet neighborhood, metal roof. We priced it at $365,000.\n",
    "1 week after the listing went up, Zillow, with no explanation, dropped the Zillow estimate to $308,000. This immediately dropped the number of people who \"saved\" the listing to 0 - and made the house.

This is completely unacceptable and we are filing complaints with our state attorney general's office and online business ratings.

    "We posted our home on Zillow in August. For the first 9-10 days the Zillow Zestimate was right about in-line with our asking price. About day 10, the Zestimate fell $70,000 - well below our appraised value and the value of homes in our area. I tried desperately to contact Zillow to determine what had happened. After about five days and finding their phone number and leaving several messages I was told by \"Phillip\" that: \"We recently launched an update to the Zestimate algorithm, improving accuracy across the country. As a result, some Zestimates increased immediately, while some decreased. The change you're seeing is a direct result of this algorithm update.\".\n",
    "We live in VT, and the database may not be as robust as other areas, but their new algorithm greatly undervalued our home (by ~$60,000). I asked that they immediately remove our listing - and was told to do it myself online. I explained that their online system only allows us to say that the house has been sold, or under contract and will remain on the site with that notation. I was also told that they CANNOT remove the Zestimate even if there is not enough local data for the Zestimate to be accurate (minimally they should note this on the Zestimate if data is limited).\n",
    "\n",
    "That night, Zillow personnel removed our home from their site. Zillow does note that their Zestimate system should not be used as an appraisal and buyers should visit the home - but my inquiry to a local realtor was that buyers do look at that number and feel because Zillow is so big - that they must have it right. I'm now getting calls from people asking if it is still for sale. Selling a home is very stressful - Zillow added and continues to add a lot of stress to this process. My recommendation to anyone posting on Zillow - please know that the Zestimate is unknown until you post and you cannot remove it if you feel that the Zestimate is undervaluing your home. Do not use email to contact Zillow - their phone number for their corporate offices is 206-470-7000. Best of luck!\n",

I figured the loss vs their first evaluation might be worth it for a quick sale and also realized they need to make money too. But as it turns out, they want to make a lot of money. The next step was sending out some guys who spend two hours going through everything in your home and garage. I have many upgrades and all the major appliances, lights etc worked fine. The bottom line is they came back and said I would have to take off the price an additional $11,000 for repairs including replacing things that work fine. They also take 9% plus various other fees, and some other internal fees to come up with a final price of 257,000.\n",
    "In other words, the original price of 305,000 which they used to get me into the process, was actually almost $50,000 less when paying for all their fees, commissions and demands for remodeling. I was for wasting my time, and for delaying me putting it on the market for a process that took over a month. My advice to anyone is don't get caught up in their game. I do not feel they are upfront or honest about what they intend to do when the final offer is made. This is obvious now that I have gone through it. Get someone excited with a market price, reduce it in the disclaimer but only enough to keep you interested. Then send out some guys to find out as much wrong as possible, things that no one would do working with a professional realtor looking out for your interests (who by the way is a lot less commission as well). The only reason I can figure they go through all this is to flip the property quickly at your expense. Buyer beware!\n",

    "We contacted Zillow because we needed to relocate for a job and needed the chance to sell our home quickly. This is the biggest regret I have throughout the home buying/selling process. Shortly after contacting Zillow, I read reviews after the fact & immediately regretted having ever called them but I went ahead with scheduling the evaluation anyway just in case. I really wasn’t sure if they actually would decrease our home value.\n",
    "We contacted a realtor as a backup and he already valued our home at Zillow’s price before any repairs were deducted. Zillow contacted us today and informed us that they couldn’t even tell us the estimate on the home because we were working w/ a realtor and that they could only speak to the broker. And also now we would have to pay Zillow & the realtors commissions if we went with Zillow’s offer. We left off telling them we would be in touch if we wanted to proceed further.\n",

    "I sign onto Zillow today and they have decreased our home's value by $25,000 in one day which is a massive hit to a home trying to sell for under $200,000. I am royally upset and offended. I was very polite with them and if I wasn’t afraid of them lowballing us, which almost every review has said they do then I would’ve gladly never contacted a realtor.

    "Talked to a woman at Zillow on 9/12/2019. Her name is Shelby. She told me I need a CMA to determine the value of my home before Zillow can purchase it from me. I get a call from Active Realty based in Corona, CA. They perform a CMA and they value comes in at $930k. Much different from the low Zillow Zestimate. When I ask how the Zillow purchase will work, she writes me, \"No, your house will not go to Zillow. We are going to list it.\" I ask why? She says, \"Your house is too special and therefore, we must list it.\"\n",

    "UPDATED 9/26/2020: In 8/2019, I made the decision to cancel my advertising. A guy name Shelby then took it upon himself to threaten to close my advertising account. I was month to month was well within my rights. Fast forward to 2020, I came to find out he did just that. He suspended the account simply because I cancelled my advertising. Then blacklisted in the system not allowing me to advertise again. All simply because I did not want to spend. He called it the \"non-Zillow way\" and defamed me in the system to not able to use it again. In attempting to address, I was told by rep if you complain about Zillow - complain about their ridiculous rates or refuse to spend more when they ask they will simply threaten to close your account. In short, Zillow is blackmailing agent into spending more money, which technically is not legal in US.\n",
    "ORIGINAL REVIEW: After advertising on Zillow I soon found that their promises of real estate leads were not only misleading but false advertising. When I went to cancel a guy named Shelby who claimed to be a billing manager threatened that I continue to pay them (even though the account was month to month) or else he disable my account. He first tried to get me to stay and then when I passed he then tried blackmail. Keeping it simple Zillow has given new meaning to customer service. They deceive agents and don't deliver the leads they promise them. I would not recommend their service to anyone.\n",

    "If I could give zero stars I would. Zillow dropped the value of my home over $50,000 overnight and raised my next door neighbor's $30,000 at the same time. Before this it was listed in value comparable to other homes in our neighborhood until this change. My home has just been renovated and my neighbor's has not. When I contacted Zillow, they just blamed a new algorithm and really did not seem to care. Was told this was an error with their new algorithm, but they could not look into it. Very poor business practices if they can do this and not even seem concerned. Zillow should not legally be able to show a Zestimate value of any kind on privately held property without having some responsibility to those Property Owners. I spoke with a Real Estate Broker and they feel the home value was correct before Zillow's new Algorithm. I guess whatever their Algorithm says is what you get no matter if it is inaccurate.\n",

If you don't accept their offer, they will dramatically lower the estimated value of your home on their website in order to discourage other potential buyers.

I get a call that afternoon from Zillow and put me on the phone with their broker. He starts the hard sell immediately. He says I need to put $30,000 updates into the house and he has someone to finance it.

They take statistics and use them for their own benefit rather than as a trusted source and connector with professionals they used to be. Just very shady and misleading, not what I would have expected. Would have expected a lowish offer like $277k or $270k. $222k was literally Zillow talking out of both sides of their mouth.

    "Zillow's \"Zestimate\" needs to be eliminated due to the fact that it is consistently inaccurate. My next door neighbor and I bought our homes at the same time in 2004 when we were building. Technically, we paid $100 more for our house. Two years ago they sold after doing some modest updates to the home such as laminate wood-like flooring. It sold for $427,000. Just as I began to prepare my home to sell, I noticed my home on Zillow began to go down. It dropped $15,000 in two months. Strangely, my neighbor's home (the new neighbors), shot up overnight (yes, overnight) $40,000. While they had never mentioned to me that they were doing any major renovations to the house, I went over to speak to them and asked if they had done any renovations. They said no, and when they asked me why was I asking, I explained about Zillow's Zestimate.\n",
    "They were quite surprised and didn't know anything about it, being that they have kids in elementary school and have no plans to move until the kids graduate high school or even after college. I notified Zillow and got their stock response, that they have no control over their own Zestimates. After reviewing the listed comparables I saw the problem. They are comparing my home to smaller homes with less square footage, most in different neighborhoods (ours is considered a high end neighborhood in our Florida community, which has low, median and high end homes. Mine and those in our section of the neighborhood are considered median. My neighbor's home's comparables are the higher end homes, both in and out of the subdivision. Aha. But Zillow doesn't see it that way, and of course, they have no control over their erroneous estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue is that Zillow needs to be consistent and accurate. Its system is anything but accurate. The greatest problem with this is that I applied for a home equity loan to do some repairs and updating. The bank said they go by Zillow estimates and because of that, they would have to give me a smaller loan than I originally would have gotten due to the extreme decline of my home. No kidding. While Zillow claims they cannot control their Zestimates, they admitted to me that they realize their Zestimates are affecting homeowners and are working to improve their system. But I thought it was all perfect and out of their control? Which is it?\n",

    "The other piece of information I learned from a co-member on LinkedIn is that an update to the Zillow software reflects an appreciation formula for houses that were ever foreclosed on. My house was not purchased as a foreclosure when I bought it. The owner invested in significant improvements, all new electrical, plumbing and a remodel. However, when HE bought the house in 2008, it was a Foreclosure.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's happened? My zestimate will NOT account for Current Market Values in my neighborhood. It is reflecting, erroneously, some weird calculation that only accounts for an appreciation percentage since I purchased. What it does not account for is the $65K increase in value from the day I closed escrow, as I had purchased the house as a Lease Option, my price was negotiated one year earlier. (2015) Zillow will not talk to me. You cannot remove your house from the Zillow platform, I have no choice but to sue for an injunction.\n",

    "For many years I was paying them as a premier agent but all they got me were window shoppers. During that time I was told by many customers, buyers that I had helped find homes, that they had put in wonderful reviews but Zillow never showed them on their site. When they merged with Trulia, they even lost one of my reviews. Recently I have tried getting my reviews but there is no one to call unless you are a premier agent. They just fleece agents and give almost nothing in return. I also tried getting them to correct descriptions of my listings that they obtained from my MLS incorrectly listing them as \"Apartments for Sale\" instead of \"Multifamily homes for sale\" that they really are - no luck there either. This company has monopolized the real estate market and they should be broken up or dissolved completely.\n",

When I checked the same listings on Realtor.com, the data appeared much more accurate. It seems like Zillow does not have any checks in place to prevent, for example, a condominium or apartment reporting 46 acres of land attached to their property. This would be such an easy fix, but I guess it's not important to Zillow like it is to other websites.

It sucks if you are really trying to refinance or sell because assessors these days look upon Zillow as a sort of bible, which is also crap because if that is true then who needs them if they can't read the market and make a fair assessment. I receive these monthly/bi-monthly emails from Zillow on the value of my house. In January 2019 they sent that my house was valued at $195,794. In March 2019 they sent an email saying my value was at $191,342. Then in April 2019, I received an email that the value of my home was $166,371 with a big green arrow saying that my home value was up. What the hell?? Algorithm fail?\n",

It's all about the risk to a bank and if they were against risk then 2008 wouldn't have happened, right? It can't hurt to advocate for yourself. You are your own advocate. Good luck out there.\n",

    "Attention All Real Estate Agents!!! Be careful before you do business with Zillow, when you pay for a certain Zip code to run your Lead Generation Campaign as a Realtor. They will promise a lot and under deliver and sometimes they don't deliver at all, they will take money and try to sell you three times of what your Budget is. The contract that they have written it 100% to their Favor and it to Protect them and is unfair.

    "Briefly. My Zestimate went from 600k a year ago to 467k this month. Been in the house 8 years and paid more for it then. Tax appraisal is $ 545K now. House next to mine cost 100k less than mine, has an Zestimate of 20k more than mine and a house two doors away exactly like mine with similar options, same property size but my options increased the SF on mine by 750 SF, has a Zestimate of $599k. There is zero consistency. Their logarithms are incorrect and their effect on people trying to sell their homes can be devastating They are shrewd, crooked and should be nobody's source for home values. Get an appraisal by an accredited appraiser in your area and go with that.\n",

    "Yes Zillow and Zillow Zestimate are a scam just like the other reviews. I initially saw the market value of my house go up in value the next two years per Zillow and Zillow Zestimate and Zillow marketing graph. The Zillow Market graph shows that my house value will go up into the year 2020 so I decided to list my house for sale by owner on Zillow the day I entered the information and got a confirmation email that my listing was live. My property value Zestimate decrease by $50,000. One month later my house decreased another $7,000 on Zestimate.\n",
    "Here is the second part of the scam. Last week I had over 1,500 views and 51 saves. Then 3 days later I had only 1100 views and 41 C's. How is that possible? Zillow is manipulating the metrics so you have to list with a real estate agent. The real estate agents pay Premiere Zillow real estate agent money. This is how the Zillow scam works. This is how Zillow makes their money. Attached is the Zillow Market graph for my area. Clearly shows the house market increasing but they decreased my house value by almost $60,000. Also be careful of HouseCanary appraisals. Same type of scenario.\n",

I recently had Zillow make an offer on my house without a realtor to represent me. Below is listed the numbers they provided. Paint the exterior of the house to cover all discolorations caused from age and exposed elements. Sand and paint or stain cabinets in the kitchen to cover any scratches and make them appear as new. Whole house touch up of any dents or holes in the drywall and match the texture to the current texture of drywall. Room by room paint touch ups of any faded, scratched or chipped paint, best matching the current color. Paint $135 per 5 gallon, 5 Gallons covers 2000 sq. ft. Repaint Interior and Exterior 50 Gallons. Over Estimate. Total $1350 x 3 to include labor cost. $4050.\n",

French Door to replace old door. $642x3 to include labor $1926. Replace Front door $961.X3 for labor $2883. Purchase, deliver and install new dishwasher and microwave. Dishwasher. $399.00x3 for install, labor $1200. Microwave. $249x3 for labor $750. Estimated cost to do repairs without hiring someone. $3600 (all items found on Lowe's). Estimate cost to do repairs with hiring someone: $10000 (Contractor Cost is an estimate). Zillow's estimate: $28078. All Items listed on the repair sheet are classified as upgrades in the Real Estate field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of these items Zillow did no breakdown the cost for me as they stated they would in phone conversations. The only cost breakdown I got was in reference to overall cost. Initial offer was $274999, which is a good price and fair value. Initial Estimate of all cost was $24199. This included all closing costs, fees, and an estimated repair cost. Comes out to about 9%. Average Realtors in my area costs cover about 8% so very competitive.\n",

    "After their home inspection the new offer that came back was still $274999 with the following fees added. $18425 for Service, $28078 for Seller Concession (“repairs”), $2596 for Closing Cost. I would walk away with $225900, I bought the house for $236000. I would walk away negative $9000 after my house value went up $40000.\n",

    "After receiving all the information, Heather ** was rude once I told them how absurd their offer was. Additionally, they sent over 2 documents after I told them I was not interested in selling to them for their end price. The first was the overall sell of the house for my review if I wished to change my mind. The second document they sent was a document for me to agree to use them as my realtor, this was not explained to me by them in any way or was I warned this document coming.\n",

    "While I recognize that the Zestimate is an approximation, our exact Zestimate was 320 with a range of 304-340k. Zillow proclaims that their Zestimate feature has a median margin of error of 4%. Zillow offered 272k for my house as an initial offer without even seeing the home. The Zestimate is projecting at 332k in 12 months which is indicative of an increase in home value of 4% in a year. In addition, Zillow also features 36k in fees for selling my home to them which equates to a 13% hit on profits. This does NOT include the 6% commission that would have gone to my realtor.\n",
    "Zillow is not serious about purchasing houses. Zillow is using this tool to generate leads for their home mortgage business (when I purchase a new house) and for providing leads to agents that agree to advertise with them. When I had no interest in Zillow mortgages and no interest in any of their real estate agents, Zillow came in remarkably below their own provided Zestimates. I couldn't encourage folks to avoid this product, enough. Total sham and a waste of time and energy.\n",

Also they only have half the story on this home and the fact that there are NO comparables since this is a totally custom home on 1.67 acres with large structures on two levels- the home on the upper level and the large 4 car garage with offices/art studio below and separated by a $70,000 built, paved road. Also fantastic views 360 degrees from the home and over 180 degrees from the structure down below.

She put in all the information including photos. What Zillow posted is not the description she wrote and no photos. Instead they posted a listing description from a previous listing agent when I bought the house 7 years ago. The information is old, inaccurate and incomplete plus it makes it look like we plagiarized that agent's work. The square footage is wrong which makes the asking price look unreasonable per square ft. All we get are phone calls from as much as hundreds of miles away from agents wanting to list the property. My daughter has tried twice to edit the listing with no success. She tried to delete it off the site but that does not work either. All of this can be detrimental to my selling the property.

    "I am thinking of selling my house and the idea of not having to go through the inconvenience and stress of having home showings, open houses and the constant burden of selling was appealing to me so I contacted Zillow. I had a pleasant young man take my information and provide an offer that was below their \"Zestimate\" of $299K, at ~$280, then minus fees and charges. While this sounded a bit much, they then offered a \"free inspection\" with no obligation so they could assess the condition of the property and determine if there is a need for repairs, cleaning, painting etc.\n",
    "When I had contacted Opendoor regarding this same process, they required a contingent signature so I thought, with Zillow, at least I didn't have to sign anything. As part of this upfront process, they required I submit a few pictures of my property as part of the purchase offer price. They asked for a few pictures of the floors, appliances, etc. which all seemed reasonable if they were going to provide an offer in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"inspector\" came out on a Sunday, was prompt and friendly. I was recovering from an illness so I did not have the energy to follow him from area to area of the house so allowed him to do his \"inspection\" and let me know if he had any questions. I heard one faucet turn on, he switched on my A/C and ran the garbage disposal. His remaining time here was spent taking pictures on his high resolution iPad. Interestingly he had no interest in seeing some of the areas of the home but, being that I was on some cold medication and feeling unwell, I chalked it up to they saw the home was in great condition and didn't need to document every square inch.\n",
    "\n",
    "My home is 1,700 square feet so, as you can imagine, he took a lot of pictures of certain things, being here nearly an hour. I have had home inspections before and, a true inspection, does require things like inspecting the attic, checking the hot water (he did not run the faucet long enough for hot water to get through the pipe), hot water heater, irrigation system, drains and toilets, etc. Again, probably dense on my part but I figured they knew what they needed to validate in order to finalize my offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"inspection\" occurred on a Sunday afternoon and by Monday mid-morning, I had a call, from a different person at Zillow because my friendly contact I had been working with to date was \"unavailable\". We set a time to go over my revised offer for Tuesday morning. When the call came in, this different Zillow rep stated that he had some local real estate agent on the line that was going to talk me through my offer and he would be on mute in case I had questions for him. This woman started off by saying, \"Unfortunately, Zillow does not buy homes that have aluminum wiring from the power line running to the main circuit breaker box. However, good news, I have a cash buyer that will give you a cash offer by tomorrow morning if you would like to sell. Of course, due to this costly repair of changing the wiring, our offer will be much lower.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, being a seasoned business person, I smelled a rat BIG time and said so. I hadn't quite put all the pieces together when I told them this but I knew something was not on the up and up. They tried to talk their way around the issue but frankly, enough of my time was wasted and so I ended our call. I immediately contacted my electrician, primarily because I was concerned I now had a fire hazard based on what they told me. He said it was not accurate and to go walk out my front door and see that every other neighbor in the neighborhood has this same wiring. He also said that if it was the East Coast, it may present more of a hazard but in the desert climate we have, it was standard (and not something he has ever heard of being redone for a home sale). I also checked these wiring facts with the home inspection association and reviewed the city code for this and found the same to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I called my power company and spoke to a representative there who also stated similar detail. I began to put the pieces together more and contacted them to find out (1) why they even bothered to invest any resources in providing an \"inspection\" if they did not buy homes with aluminum power feed and it is a well known fact that in my city homes built during a certain time frame all had this and (2) why was their inspector in my home for so long if he could plainly see from the street that my house, and every house for blocks in every direction has these power feeds and they don't buy these homes and (3) how does this agent have any info on my home when I did not authorize Zillow to share my information or pictures of my private residence with her.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am certain I will get no reply but needed to illustrate to them that they are not as slick as they seem to think they are. How many people have fallen for this? As I shared my story with friends, I have found out this happens ALL THE TIME. So, after scaring the heck out of me that I might have a fire hazard, and insulting my basic intelligence with their attempted heist, I searched and found all of these 1 star reviews of varying experiences with a variety of Zillow services and see that this is indeed their standard mode of operation. After seeing some of these reviews from real estate agents and their Zillow experiences, I wonder if the agent put on the line with me was even aware of the situation when she was \"referred\" to me. The whole thing is so unethical and predatory. How are they able to legally get away with this?\n",

    "I've put a home up for sale by owner, a 2 bedroom condo, on the Zillow site. Claiming the home, entering the description details and adding photos was all pretty straightforward. Creating the owner estimate was easy as well. The Zestimate that is generated started out at around the expected price based on comparable research. Then over a few days the Z estimate steadily decreased. When I looked at what is shown as comparable under the Z estimate I was surprised to see 90% of the comps used by Zillow are one bedroom condos. There was a condo in the same building that is identified as a 2 bedroom, but, it is not a 2 bedroom it is a 1 bedroom with a really low price. This might not be Zillow issue since the data they pulled from is incorrect. I fail to see how those listing are considered comparable, but, the Zillow/system think they are.\n",
    "I have been steadily been leading the number of views on the listing compared to others in the area. Questions come in asking why the price is what it is compared to the Zestimate. I have only found a phone number as a way to contact. Seems there is no other way to contact Zillow or to get a person on the phone. The only thing that you are able to reach is voicemail. The voicemail says please leave a detailed message of what you are experiencing so that they can research it and get back to you. I've left 4 voicemails and it's been 2 weeks and no one has gotten back to me. The Zestimate is so far out of whack that it's laughable. The customer support is non existent.\n",

    "We are basing our experience regarding Zillow's FSBO option on two experiences; one was a little over a year ago and one is most recent. Zillow lures homeowners to list FSBO for free and the point of that is so that realtors know you are looking to sell your property, then they will call you nonstop to get you to list with them. Some even went as far as threatening us. Our homes were in great condition and our homes usually get the most attention and traffic on Zillow. The first home we listed had a Zestimate of 95K. The area was experiencing a great sellers' market and our home had over 120 saves and was constantly ranked number 1 on Zillow. Well that may seem like good news to the Seller/homeowner, but it was bad news for realtors and Zillow because it was FSBO. Zillow even erased all the saves after a couple of months.\n",
    "Furthermore, realtors started low balling us, in an effort to pressure us to list. We even heard from potential buyers, who eventually reached us that they called agents (since Zillow places them at the top and puts homeowner's number at the bottom) only to be told to AVOID our property and fabricated lies as to why the Buyer should not purchase it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times we told realtors who asked to list the property, why not bring a serious buyer and we will give you Buyer agent commission. Time and time again they failed to deliver!!! Instead, they tried to pressure us to list with them. Well, needless to say, we did not! That's when homes listed by Agents in the area started experiencing higher Zestimates and ours started experiencing a trend in the opposite direction. Our home was immaculate compared to the nearby listings. We inquired from Zillow why the trends in the opposite direction and they reassuring us that they do not manipulate their algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started taking photos of the other homes and their condition and compared with our condition as they said recent sales influence the Zestimates, still we saw trends in opposite direction for our home versus those listed by agents. It appears it was Zillow's way of ensuring that our house would have a harder time selling. We did not give in and in fact sold our home for about 50K more than the Zestimate and at full asking price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we are selling another home FSBO and the trends are no different. They have reduced our value by 20K and it continues to decrease as sales pick up and other homes down the street are valued higher because they are listed by Realtors. Zillow and its practices are unethical and from what I have read there are lawsuits regarding the Zestimate and some of the practices Zillow applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you list FSBO (especially if you have a beautiful home) be prepared to get bombarded by Agents who want to list your property but will NOT bring one serious buyer to you. You have to hope that the right buyer is smart enough to pick up on everything and make you a fair offer based on the comps and what your home has to offer. Just thought to share our experience so that if you plan to list FSBO, you know what to expect.\n",

I believe they attempt to low ball my property in order to make it easy for realtors to sell. For FSBO sales you never get leads, because they post agents on your site, who pay for placement then they call you with buyer. The lead should be yours, instead the realtor gets it and you have to pay the realtors. Most realtors are weak and can't sell unless property is deeply discounted, not good.\n",

I asked to talk to a supervisor and without even putting me on hold said the supervisor was in a meeting. I have requested a call back from someone who will not be threatening or rude to explain their policy. Have not heard back yet. They do not even have a live person answering their customer service number listed and you have to google phone number for Zillow. Not even on their website.\n",

    "We went under contract with Zillow in May 2018 and (signed a Dotloop document) that stated what our ad spend was and their ad match. Suddenly we were being charged over $300 MORE than agreed upon. I spoke to our \"rep\" asking if our lender had stopped paying. She said no. When I saw the charge appear again I called and was told I authorized the ad spend increase. No I never did. I asked to have it removed and they have still not removed it. I asked about the ad match we had been guaranteed and was reflected on our contract. I was told we never had an ad match and they could find no contract. The \"manager\" Jose that we spoke with was completely unsympathetic and refused to assist or credit me back my money they overcharged, fix the ad match or adjust the account. FRAUD!!

    "I had an inaccurately negative review written on me, and the Zillow website does not give an option for me to respond with my side. I wrote Zillow twice refuting how the review was inaccurate. The reviewer complained mainly on pricing. Notwithstanding the fact I have written evidence proving the reviewer skewed the facts in her complaint, the other metrics upon which I was rated poorly had nothing to do with her complaint. The reviewer simply could not afford the property, and she blamed her inability to purchase on our 'unfair pricing.' But Zillow didn't bother fact-checking this. So for the sake of the argument let's say that the reviewer had a legitimate complaint about the pricing (somehow it was our fault she couldn't afford it).\n",
    "How can I be rated with one star on responsiveness, work quality and punctuality when the reviewer did not complain about these? I have proof that I was very, very responsive to her. I have also requested several vendors (I do not have employees) and tenants to provide reviews on me if they were satisfied with our working relationship. At least one vendor told me Zillow keeps kicking back his review for changes because they were too positive. So far only the one negative one star review has been allowed, no questions asked. This is slander, and Zillow is complicit in allowing this smear upon my branding by 1) not allowing me to respond publicly with my side, and 2) having a higher bar for posting positive reviews than negative ones. Somehow negative reviews require no fact checking but positive reviews require 'toning down.'\n",

    "Zillow Offers says they make an initial offer based on seller disclosures, market value and images the seller provide. If you choose to accept the initial offer and move forward, Zillow will do an in home evaluation. All good so far... Here is where the fun comes in. After the in home evaluation, Zillow adjusts their price by asking for concessions AND a lot of them!!! They will charge you for new paint, laundry room demolition, (you read that right), pool cleaning and demo of items not conveying!!!. Zillow then states that none of it was accounted for in the initial offer... Really Zillow? Why did I send you photos and disclose to get the original offer? Bait and switch? YES! Paying to flip my own house? YES! Shady business practice waiting for the seller with no other options? ABSOLUTELY!\n",

Having watched the home listing on Realtor and also Zillow, some things become apparent. 1. Viewers of the home fluctuates up and down as well as those that save the sight. No big deal.2. The most disturbing thing is that the Zillow estimate also fluctuates.

Zillow claims that you can convert these leads in the long run by following their conversion plan. It didn't work and I spent my time and money in vain. As a matter of fact, most of the so called leads want the listing agent. When they find that you are not the listing agent they will specifically tell you that they don't want to work with you.\n",

    "So after sitting through a presentation over the phone where the Zillow representative showed my partner and I how the Premier Agent can benefit from paying Zillow $430 we agreed to pay the $430 for 30% of the local market. Being new in real estate we believed them when they said this was really the best and only way to get solid leads with pre-screened buyers. When we hesitated to do it, she responded that this was a now or never deal. So we took the deal hesitantly.\n",
    "Then the next month we were charged another $430. I called and asked what was going on and she said that we were under a 6 month contract. When I asked to see this contract that we were unaware of when we signed up initially she sent me over a contract with my name on it, the amount charged, but no signature. She cannot provide a signed contract by me nor will she release me from this contract that I had never seen or signed before. It's like they forgot to complete the step because they were too focused on getting our money.\n",

    "We trusted Zillow because they are a big giant in real estate. This was to our detriment because apparently they can continue to charge you every month without providing the agent with anything other than listing your name along with several other agents next to listings that buyers look at. They don't pre-screen them as promised either. All around a truly bad experience. Use your marketing money somewhere else.

The Zillow Zestimate and RANGE feels like a bait and switch tactic, as the offer they gave us BEFORE deducting paint, carpeting, etc from the price, was not even INSIDE the Zillow Zestimate range, which was between $433k-$480k and there was nothing wrong with our house besides some minor things.\n",
    "Zillow charges the home seller BOTH a LISTING AGENT COMMISSION AND BUYING AGENT COMMISSION. If you're going to be charged these realty fees anyway, you might as well actually use a Listing agent and Buying agent who will present you with multiple offers and are motivated to get the highest price for your house so they can get better commissions. Why pay these fees if you're not actually getting the best price?\n",

    "After using this \"contact\" service for some time, the efficacy of the contacts had degraded. The employee that called me this morning, Lauren, gave me her explanation of the stock market, recent election and several other factors, all of which I'm sure the management team at Zillow decided is the best was to handle subscribers that call to complain about the quality of their offering. I'll assume Lauren, a customer advocate person, is going through this daily.\n",
    "As I began explaining the challenges I've had, Lauren's only solution was to \"let you out of your contract\". Lauren stated \"this is service is no longer working for you\". I was simply looking for an explanation why I had not received the services that were explained to me (warm transfer of \"qualified\" contacts) that some other Zillow employee stated I would receive when they adopted the new one contact per month for $500 fee. None of that happened either. Maybe others have experienced a higher level of service and better payoff, but when I tried to explain that I had not received a single qualified buyer contact in nearly three months (Lauren didn't offer any of my money back), Lauren's solution was to go back when I did get a buyer that closed to explain to me that my ROI should be sufficient to absorb the months where their service lacked luster.\n",

    "Instead of offering a different zip-code area, using her statistics to overcome my concerns, offering some type of benefit for retention of my subscription, her only option was cut-bait and get to the next person, of course...

The only reason Lauren called was to rebuke everything I stated as an area of concern, rather Lauren was super focused on her statistics and analysis of a market, over 2500 miles away from her office, insisting she was the queen of contact conversion and she was there to help me understand how to be more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lauren's condescending attitude is, for some reason, what I expected as a typical response. Lauren was quick to terminate my subscription, so as to make sure I'm \"totally satisfied\". This will allow the lack of leads to go to a smaller subscriber audience, and maybe they'll be happy with them. I'm putting my marketing dollars into realtor.com and maybe Lauren will sleep better knowing there's one less angry agent that she or her colleagues will need to contend with moving forward.\n",

I signed into Zillow and found my home immediately dropped 35,000 in value making it the lowest priced home in my subdivision... Lower than a house less than 2/3 its size. The drop then slowly came back to where it was when I purchased it about 6 months later. I updated the pictures both inside and out and fixed the description.\n",
    "After doing that I received a threatening notice from Zillow taking down all my pictures and deleting the description and telling me it was not my house and they were turning me over to law enforcement. I was never contacted. They also deleted my access to the house. This year, 2018, I was able to get back in and post several pictures but am still unable to fix the description. My house is now going down in value for the last 2 months where all the other houses in the 115 house subdivision are going up. The average selling price for a home in this subdivision is in excess of 100/sq.ft. Yet Zillow values them much lower. No matter how many times I point this out they just give me their standard algo crap. They are so far off base that they even use the value of over 1000 mobile homes with no land to compute the residence value of a house.\n",

I reminded them that it is damaging to the homeowner when this occurs, and asked them on multiple occasions to either correct or remove the Zestimate. The neighboring property is IDENTICAL to mine in every way (same subdivision, built in 2017, same floor plan, same condition,etc.) and the Zestimate this property is using the SAME SALES COMPS As with mine. So why is my value coming out differently?!! No customer service phone number, and no way to escalate and issue. ** Zillow!! I will NEVER use them, and I will NEVER let my agent post with them.\n",

    "I have been advertising with Zillow as a premier agent for 5 months now, and I can tell you that it is 100% a scam. I needed a new place to allocate some advertising dollars and decided to give Zillow a try. The sales rep, Lindsay **, told me the number of leads per zip I would receive (43) for the spend I was willing to do ($3,000 a month). Zillow makes you sign a 6 month contract, and I was a bit hesitant to commit to $18,000 for 6 months worth of advertising. Over the first few months I realized that I made a terrible mistake. I would say 90% of the leads are absolutely worthless. I have had one guy contact me through Zillow and ask what the number was for Zillow's customer service. Are you kidding me? That counts as a one of my leads. Just yesterday I had a lady who barely spoke a lick of English call and ask what was going on with this particular property.\n",
    "After a few questions I was able to ascertain that she wrote up an offer on this property and wanted to know what happened!!! Instead of calling the agent who wrote up the offer she submitted an inquiry on Zillow. What do you know, that counts as a lead against me. To top it all off the 43 leads I was sold on has now dwindled to 23 in month #5. Each month they sell more advertising so the number of leads per share goes down, but the amount they charge me does not go down relatively. It is borderline criminal. It is a SCAM. I asked my marketing rep, Jeff **, to see if he can cancel my last month. Of course he could not. Ha, what was I thinking. They do not want to lose out on screwing me for that last $3,000. In closing, I want to get the word out to everyone in the business so maybe I can save someone else from getting scammed. Learn from my mistake, DO NOT ADVERTISE ON ZILLOW.\n",

    "I was curious to know the value of the homes in my neighborhood. The exact same house as mine just sold last month after the first owner passed away. I went on Zillow website just to see what they had it listed for. The house across the street sold for 32k less than Zillow listed. So I called a realtor to come out. Actually I called 4 realtors who sell homes in the area. Each agent who knows nothing about each other, priced my home within $500-$1000 from each other. Zillow have my home priced $25k over the value. I contacted Zillow to ask them to take my home off their site because they are reporting numbers just to draw attention to their business and my home is not and won’t ever be for sale so there isn’t any reason to list it.\n",
    "Zillow customer service department contacted me back to tell me that Zillow isn’t a realtor, they just offer the public a starting point when buying or selling. Zillow stated that they use MLS and the county’s assessment. That is false also. Because according to my assessment, they are now pricing my home at $75k over value. What kind of starting point are they offering if they are already $25k overpriced. This company is just another website that’s trying to get exposure to bring their ratings up. No matter how unrealistic their findings are. And with all the misleading, false information and all the complaints, it’s really amazing that the State Department still allowing them to remain in business. I read that a judge dismissed the class action lawsuit against Zillow as well. With all of this information right in front of them, this company still able to remain in business and report unrealistic false information.\n",

    "We are thinking of selling our home in the next few years. While researching comparable sales in my area of New Jersey, I noticed that Zillow's \"zestimate\" was very low. I updated some incorrect information and added some details that were missing from their description. My property immediately lost more than $30,000 in value. Zillow's estimate my home's value is now approximately 50% of what it should sell for. This figure is so absurd that it would be laughable if not for my nagging fear that it may lead buyers to think my home is worth less than it is. I have been unable to change this figure and my calls and emails to Zillow have gone unanswered. I learned that a class action suit against Zillow was recently dismissed. Unfortunately, this turn of events will allow Zillow to continue to harm both buyers and sellers. BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY AND THEIR UNETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES.\n",

We purchased the home for $870K. Three weeks after we closed the Zillow dropped the home estimate to $750K. I complained but they said that the price change is due to \"changed algorithm\" and refused to move it up despite my proofs (the professional estimates and the purchase price). I also argued that no algorithm could change the price from 1.1M to 750K. Interestingly, the builder also told us at the time of contract that the brand new home like ours would be worth 1.1M, thus I wonder if the Zillow's previous \"estimate\" was higher because it was paid for.\n",

If you are a realtor thinking about buying their leads at least in this area, think twice or more. After 3 months, I am still waiting for closing at least one. You are better off using that money somewhere else. If you would like to try it anyway, do not sign a contract, do month by month so you can get out as soon as you realize you aren't going anywhere with them.\n",
    "Their sales team will do everything in their power to trick you into buying though. Do not fall for it. They'll try to make you think that you are not working the leads like you are supposed to, but again, don't fall for it. There is a difference between a lead and just some random phone numbers contacting you because they don't know what they are doing, just don't know what they want. Most of them are trying to contact the owner of the property or trying to contact the listing agent, you'll even get calls from another realtor that thinks Zillow is the right place to contact another agent, even another realtor thinking you are the listing agent. Just terrible.\n",

    "When I google my address, Zillow brings up a line that says this house is currently not for sale, even though it's listed with over 900 realtors and it shows it for sale on its website. Also, when you look at the property history it says listing removed, which is completely false. What happened is a buyer signed a contract, then changed their mind. After the contract was signed, the realtor naturally listed it as pending sale. When it went back on the market, she removed the Pending sale-twice-but Zillow still shows listing removed. This site is completely incompetent.\n",

I commented on one of their post on Facebook and they deleted my comment not once but twice!!! I have emailed them. They said my request was received but nothing else!! I have had 2 people call me and say, \"How can your home be only worth 192,000,\" and of course I explained. We have had 1239 views on our home and 1 showing. By the way our home is a 4 bedroom 2 1/2 bath over 2600 square feet and it sits on almost 12 acres of land and several other features that are listed with this property.

There is usually a sign in front of the house, I would def call that number and inquire about what Zillow has posted...IT IS NOT THE SAME INFORMATION. TRUST ME! I almost gave my personal information.

    "We have lost a buyer due to flawed Zestimate which is $65,000 lower than our professional market/bank appraisal. Texas is a non-disclosure state. Therefore Zillow cannot get comps. They guess at values. This is very damaging to the relationship between professional realtors and their buyers and/or sellers. Zillow offers no way to correct faulty and damaging information or to appeal the Zestimate. They also refuse to remove a listing. We can not get a response from them. This unilateral invasion of the local real estate industry is creating confusion, frustration and harm. Zestimates need to be stopped. Buyers must rely on the expertise of local realtors who know the market, the quality and condition of the homes, not a computer algorithm in Seattle.\n",

Look at recent neighborhood sales on the map instead.\n",

From other realtors. From any other random spammer/scammer that pays Zillow for its lead list. For the last 10 days, I have been pestered non-stop from phone numbers in the area code where I contacted the realtor through Zillow, including from \"fundraisers\" and \"card services\".

I attempted to have them correct the issue, it only confused them at Zillow. They then have ignored me for over a month despite multiple emails and phone calls. I am quite upset as this can affect time it takes to place a tenant if the ad is not correct. I just want to delete the ad but there is no way to do that. I can deactivate it but not delete it.

    "My US Bank mortgage officer advised me that when beginning a refi, they often start with Zillow to get a \"ballpark\" number on the property value. He advised me to go online and check my home value at Zillow. When I initially checked it, the value was listed as $287,000. Knowing the approximate values of the homes on my street over the past years of the recession, I felt this was probably accurate. Two weeks later I signed on again, because I had forgotten the figure. This time, I found it to have an increased value of $319,000. Praise God! In just two weeks, nonetheless! I thought to myself, that perhaps the rebounding economy in the last couple of years, and the recovering of the housing market was really working its magic.\n",
    "One month after that logon, I'm pleased to announce that my home is now up to $360,000 in Zillow's opinion. I feel so sorry for all of the other 29 homes in my neighborhood, because their poor homes haven't increased in value at all, - just mine, and at this rate, I will be the proud owner of a million dollar home in just a few short years, amidst a street of $250,000 homes! Obviously, the idea is to show an increasing home value to a homeowner considering sale, which in turn make the property owners say to themselves, \"wow, I really like this site Zillow. I think I will keep using it and perhaps even consider listing my property on this site!\" Based on the other reviews concerning Zillow, I'm not sure that ANY of the data is trustworthy. Only the underlying map graphic is likely reliable.\n",

    "I’m a realtor in Orlando, FL. I had a lot of trouble when I was on Zillow with inaccurate data. They linked a brand new construction property I had recently closed, and was posted on Zillow, to a rundown mobile home that was never my listing. I called and emailed support several times and no one ever responded. So every time I got a sales call asking me to pay for leads and to get pushed in front of site users, I told them if they would fix that link I would consider paid advertising. The link was never corrected. I realized that Zillow was a lead generator for agents who pay and the data didn’t seem important to them in my opinion. The values are rarely accurate. There was a news article a while back about Zillow's CEO's own property being overvalued by 40% on Zillow compared to its sale price.\n",
    "Also during the three years I had an account on Zillow, I was contacted by people claiming to want to see homes listed as active on Zillow but when I checked the MLS the properties were either in contract or had closed or were never in the MLS. I would send MLS reports to the people confirming status and they would reply, “But it’s on Zillow,” as if Zillow were infallible. Buyers beware of any properties you find on Zillow or any other 3rd party sites. There are so many scams in real estate right now and people are losing deposits and down payments through wire frauds and even in-person with contracts that appear legit. If you can’t find the contact person on a real estate company website to verify who they are, be very careful how you proceed.\n",

He had an excuse about why the Home Away people couldn’t call me either. I regret that I sent my ID. I put out alerts on it in case they try to use it. I contacted Zillow and they said the ad had been taken down so they couldn’t do anything. So BEWARE OF SCAMMERS USING THIS SITE TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY AND YOUR MONEY!!!\n",

    "No words for these silver tongued devils! They promise great results and to provide exclusive leads. I keep finding out that other agents are working the same leads that are supposedly my exclusive leads. I have paid an incredible amount of money to these leeches only to have ZERO dollars in return. If agents would quit paying ZILLOW to take our inventory that we create and sell the leads back to us they would go away. It’s beyond comprehension how NAR, KAR and local MLS systems even have allowed this interloper to come in. ZILLOW is not a good investment for Realtors.\n",

    "Zillow has now forced agent to use their concierge service. Instead of receiving an email, they not require that we pick up the phone and be put in immediate contact with the buyer. If you do not take the call then you lose the lead. As a rural broker I spend much of my time on the road. So I am forced to take calls while I am driving which is dangerous. Further, as I am often not familiar with the property the buyer is inquiring about, I am not able to help the buyer properly. In the past we would get an email and we could look up the property, discuss it with the listing agent and discuss it intelligently with the buyer. Further, I have a team and in the past I could distribute email leads to the agent most capable of being of assistance. This is no longer possible. This is obviously another attempt by Zillow to control information with little respect for the buyers and agents that use their service.\n",

    "This is one company no one should trust their so called fake Zestimates. I will give the history of a specific home to prove that their modeling of estimates is nowhere close to Sale price and market prices. I monitor a home whose value let's say is estimated at $2.8M in very good school district and close to so many companies and easy access to freeways and much more. These estimates were rising every 15 days or so as home sales went up and had reached $2.8M. Now comes the fake information, the day this home is put on market at noon, by evening the Zestimate dropped to $2.6M - a sudden drop by $200K+. Next few days it lingered around and each day I would see different numbers and finally settling to $2.55M. When I look at the home sold and comparable homes they are at $2.9M to $3.3M. Homes are sold $350K to $600K more than the listed price. They also show list price to sold price is 118%.\n",
    "So how can one trust this website when they fake their estimates and claim they all based on similar sales with comparable homes in the neighborhood. When I collected all the data for all homes, and went by their own comparable homes, the home value estimates need to go up rather than down. Their stats are so wrong, but the average list to sold is close to accurate. So one needs to find the estimate round about way and a common person cannot get this stat directly. Zillow - just shut your business and your estimates are fake and incorrect. Until you correct them - no one gets you more business.\n",

    "Zillow inaccurately reflects our home value on their site $80,000 lower than their own valuation, which is based on 10 comps their system selected across our neighborhood. Those comps yielded a value of $550k, and yet the public view indicates the value is $470k. This problem has persisted now for weeks. After approximately 10 e-mails with customer service (including an encouraging request from Zillow for our property tax assessment statement, which I provided 2-3 weeks ago), the company continues to ignore the issue. They will only say that \"the developers are looking into it,\" which has been repeated multiple times.\n",
    "It seems necessary to take defensive action against Zillow's fraudulent misrepresentation of our property value, and negligent lack of response when proof of the tax assessment value of our property was provided as requested. We have too much at risk to sit and wait while Zillow ignores this -- which according to many other reviews on this site is apparently their standard mode of operation. It seems the business model is to intentionally reflect home values below market until they are paid to reflect the accurate value. Based on various legal arguments, it would seem this could be considered blackmail. Interestingly, Realtor.com provides a much more accurate value ($70,000 higher than Zillow's value). We have used Zillow heavily for years but will now be switching to Realtor.com for all our real estate needs.\n",

In Mark **'s article about the hidden costs of homeownership, he also talks about Zillow. After reading this article, I decided to check out the website for myself. Zillow breaks down the expenses that most people do not think about when they are purchasing a home. Zillow provides home value, price/tax history, mortgages, competition, home expenses, and more. When buying a home, there are so many \"hidden\" costs that the buyer needs to be aware of. Zillow is helpful when trying to decide if one wants to become a homeowner or a renter.\n",

We have a love/hate relationship with Zillow and we continue to seek out other options to capture these Buyers but currently, this is where consumers are going for their home searches so it is in our best interest to continue to advertise on their site. (at much $$$!)\n",
    "The reason for writing this is to reassure those with concerns about the content displayed on Zillow. Agents always... ALWAYS... RE-educate the buyers and sellers who come to us from this site due to many inaccuracies. Often the homes Buyers inquire about have already been sold, 1/2 baths are rounded up by Zillow to a full baths and the Zestimate is completely inaccurate pretty much 100% of the time.\n",

    "For these reasons alone, it would make sense that Sellers selling their home should use a Listing Agent and Buyers should be represented by a Buyers Agent. This is not a self-promotion opportunity, this is an obvious fact based on the issues listed prior. Without Agents, the inaccuracies listed online will be the only \"truth\" for Buyers; something Sellers have a difficult time overcoming by themselves. Buyers without a Buyers Agent are in jeopardy of purchasing an overpriced home if the Zestimate is much higher than market value.\n",

Unfortunately, those of us who honestly care, are required to overcome the reputation of the bad seeds in our industry who didn't.\n",

    "My house had a value of $628,000 and nothing changed, not even the houses around me and my house value dropped by $124,000 in two days. All the house around me did not change or if they did it was a couple of thousand. So all things being the same why would my house decline and everyone else's didn't. Zillow must have something very bad with the way it calculates home values. Just take a look at ** and you will see the huge difference in my house and all the other house around me stated the same.\n",

    "I own a real estate company. I wanted to try some kind of lead generating program to give leads to my agents. As Zillow being the most viewed real estate site, they had a program called \"Premier Broker\". I was impressed by the salesperson telling me that they have 11 concierge speaking at least 8 different languages. These concierge will talk to the leads and then transfer to us only the filtered leads. They will ask 2 questions. #1 \"Are you looking to buy, sell or rent?\" If answer is buy or sell, then #2 \"Do you have a real estate agent?\" If answer is \"NO\" then the lead will be connected to us. What a great service! Sounded all good.\n",
    "I was promised average of 112 leads per month for a $8000/month program which was on special so only had to pay $6000/month. Well, first 30 days we got some calls asking about rentals and leads with messages like \"do not call\" or \"lead isn't interested in talking to an agent\" or \"this lead contacted multiple agents\" or \"this lead is already working with an agent\"... All of these leads are approximately $80 each, since I paid $6000 for less than 80 total leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "I joined and willing to pay $6000/month for 112 filtered leads. I ended up with about 80 very cold leads with messages telling me not to call. 3 months after $18,000 down the drain, I finally asked to be canceled. This is not nearly what was promised. They asked me to give them a list of zip codes where I want to work. Not even 30% of the leads were from the zip codes in my list. Don't waste your money. If you still want to try, make sure to have the salesperson write down how many filtered leads, not all leads and zip codes you want to work, get that page signed. Don't make the same mistake I did, because Zillow is not cheap. They just cheat and make money from realtors.\n",

ZERO leads came in the first 30 days so I tried to cancel. No surprise, the salesman, managers, and everyone else just disappeared completely.

My neighbor's property is for sale. Our units are identical in every way. We have adjoining walls. Both units were built at the same time. My neighbor's Zestimate is over $310k higher than Zillow's Zestimate of my unit. Just like every other reviewer, contact with \"Customer Care\" is a sham. The first clue is the fact the \"person\" who answers your concerns does not even have the courage to provide his last name!

A few years back, They were sued from the outset when corporate executives left Realtor.com and allegedly took proprietary information along with them when they joined Zillow. The matter settled for $130 million dollars after the judge made a determination that at least one of the defendants had intentionally destroyed evidence. These are the people who run this operation, so it comes as no surprise that the consumer is being mislead by these folks and they do not seem to care.\n",

Assuming they would eventually remedy their error, I did nothing. Finally decided to email them and received a form letter, generic response referring me to their site for their estimate process and informing me in bold italics that they DO NOT edit estimates in response to customer feedback. How about if you acknowledge a glitch/error though and actually look at the individual case? Redfin and realtor.com both have us 200K higher than they do. Most people seem to know that Zillow estimates are all over the place and therefore mostly useless but there are those who are unaware of this and Zillow can hurt a home’s marketability with their misinformation.\n",

As a licensed Realtor for over 30 years I have to laugh when I see what their \"logarithm\" has used as comps. They are NOT UP TO DATE and from my experience are a very poor choice. Zillow states that this is a starting point... Pretty bad starting point in most cases. It is hard enough for people to go through selling a home but then you have to explain a Lowball Zestimate to a potential buyer who thinks something from Zillow should be credible. Get your local Realtor to do a comprehensive market analysis which will use up to date comps near your home and ones which better reflect the type of home you are selling and located in a like neighborhood. Zillow is a good tool for finding homes for sale in a given area, but not for determining value of a property.\n",

    "I have been searching since March 2017 for property in the Caribbean. Traveled to more than 12 islands looking for the right spot to retire. We chose Puerto Rico in May and started with 212 homes to look thru. We narrowed it down to 11 and then the Hurricanes hit. We even traveled after the Hurricanes to see if the properties fared okay and which we would be interested in. We narrowed that search to 3 properties at that time. We had already been in touch with numerous realtors trying to get more responses from them, letting them know we would be on the island searching, and wanting to look into the properties.\n",
    "We got somewhat of a \"Great! See you when you land!\" from a realtor. But other than that no response while we were on the island. Nor for a week after. We looked at the homes and decided on one of the three. Finally got a mortgage company to work with us. He took all of our personal and business info and our tax forms, bank statements etc. And that was it. Never heard a word, checked our credit to see if it had been pulled to verify for the mortgage and nothing was done.\n",

We are now making a trip to island hop onto previous islands and some new islands to see if we can find somewhere else more suitable.

    "My home (** Phx, AZ) was listed briefly through a realtor, who I fired for incompetence, and the Zillow Zestimate was $445,000 while listed. I subsequently listed this property on Zillow as a For Sale by Owner (FSBO) listing & the Zestimate home value dropped to $415,000, a 6% drop. I contacted Zillow via email to question of their proprietary algorithm for Zestimates included an added it listed through a realtor. Zillow responded with a \"non-denial denial\". It is obvious from my experience that Zillow disadvantages FSBO properties by reducing their values by 6% compared to exact same property listed thru realtor. The realtor we originally used was awful. I requested several times she perform a Comparative Market Analysis since your home has several premium features compared to other homes sold in same neighborhood. She either didn't want to or didn't know how to do this.\n",
    "I performed the CMA myself & determined a market value of $485k to $495k for my home based on Comparable properties sold w/in last five months in same subdivision Since it is a Buyer's market in our area & we want to sell within 30 days, we are asking $458,000. This reduced price has nothing to do with not using a realtor. If the market were a Seller Market & we had 90 to 120 days to sell we would have listed for $490,000. In fact, I believe the information I am providing to potential buyers is superior to that thru a realtor. The bottom line here is that Zillow is being very devious w/ their listing service of FSBO properties by purposely lowering their Zestimate values by 6% to favor properties listed through Realtors. Lastly, I am an engineer & mathematician by trade so I know of what I write & speak.\n",

    "We purchased a home 3 months ago for $189,000 which Zillow had zestimate of $190,000. Zestimate has dropped drastically down to $112,000 in less than 3 months. I have contacted Zillow and they said it's a new algorithm that has made changes. Other home around me has not changed. There is a home showing on map at $78,000 which is not in this neighborhood. The address listed on home is nowhere near here. It's is located in wrong place on map. I'm sure this has driven my zestimate down. I have reported it and so has a friend. Still not corrected. My house is marked in heart on map in attachment. See the $78k home inaccurately shown on my street? I am very upset. My home is showing at half the zestimate of all my neighbors homes.

    "I am a home owner and a real estate professional. I listed one of my own properties on the MLS and allowed for the listing to be syndicated to Zillow. After several weeks, the listing wasn't getting a ton of attention, so I decided to list it for rent again. I wanted to keep it up for sale till I had a signed lease in case a buyer came along in the meantime. It is completely legal to have a listing up for sale and rent at the same time, but Zillow apparently does not allow this. So when I tried to list my place for rent on Zillow, it was declined and wouldn't post, saying that it was already listed on Zillow for sale. So wanting to honor their protocol, I stopped the syndication from the MLS system to Zillow, which should have pulled my property from the \"for Sale\" category on Zillow. Once it's not for sale on Zillow, it should be allow me to list it for rent.\n",
    "Nearly a week later and Zillow hasn't updated the property listing status. Furthermore, even though I claimed the listing as my own, I am unable to edit it at all in Zillow because it keeps telling me that all the info for that listing if automatically fed by the info in the MLS. This is obviously not accurate since I stopped that feed 4 days ago. I've made countless attempts to contact their joke of a customer service number. I've left numerous voice mails. I've also sent numerous emails to their \"help center\" regarding this issue, only to have gotten NO response. I don't know how a company this huge can function without any customer service. I can honestly say that I've never dealt with this level of industry carelessness, apathy, and just flat out poor business practices. If I could give them zero stars, I would.\n",

    "Zillow blatantly lies about the historical \"Zestimates\" for our home. I regularly monitor my home's Zestimate, not because I'm interested in selling it--but because I want to know what my home is potentially worth. I checked today for the first time in perhaps a month and noticed it was $130,000. It seems to be creeping lower and lower. At point last year, it was Zestimated at $175,000. But I noticed that Zillow claimed my value was increasing by $10,000 over last month. Certainly not.\n",
    "I looked at the chart that shows the Zestimates over the last 10 years or so. It was completely inaccurate. It claimed that in April 2013, my house was at a low of $45,000. I've lived here since January 2013 and it was *never* $46,000. Nor would my house have *ever* sold for less than $100,000 on the market. It also did not show the period last year where my Zestimate was over $150,000 for 7 months. That was erased to show a value of $100K-$110K over the same period instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, it painted a rosy picture of a house increasing in value with the graph lines slowly going up. What a crock. I remember I emailed them a few years ago when they pulled this stunt before (I had never been under $100K at that point and suddenly I had a period that occurred 6 months in the past where I was only worth $70K) and they said I must have been mistaken. I must have looked at someone else's house. I'm not mistaken. Now you can't even contact them--there's no customer service e-mail address on their site and their Facebook page does not allow messaging.\n",

    "Stop making my house look like a dump on your website by changing old numbers. We put $40,000 in renovations and significant upgrades into it in 2015 that is part of public records because we needed town permission and we had to pull permits--information that Zillow supposedly uses and has available to make these informed decisions of value.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't really care about the value, per se, but if Zillow is going to claim this as a tool--use it responsibly, don't lie and craft figures that are part of the \"history\" and change that \"history\" as you see fit. Once a month closes, you can't go back and change the numbers. That is dishonest and makes you completely unfit to do what you claim to do. I wonder how this affects other people who are selling their homes who have *never* checked their Zestimate?\n",

The week before I plan on listing, Zillow takes their zestimate on my home and drops it 15%, making the value change so much that I am no longer to sell. In reality, local home sales have smaller, worse condition homes selling for higher amounts than the original zestimate. I contact them to let them know this and their response is, \"It's our algorithm and we won't change the zestimate because it's correct.\" Well, it's way off, and potential buyers will change their perspective. This hurts many individuals who are selling and buying homes when their algorithm is incorrect. Who can do something about this business practice that hurts sellers mostly because buyers truly do use the zestimate in making offers.\n",

    "Completed listing for my condo on July 3rd, ran into many strange, time consuming messages on the website but did get it through. They emailed back twice I needed to remove my phone number from the ad itself because it was \"self-promoting.\" Of course, it's not, I'm just a condo owner, but I did and resubmitted immediately asking them to post without the number in the listing. I've been doing this over and over again, the message states it will be posted within 72 hours, but something very wrong is going on here. A lot of people use Zillow and this is a real problem for me - they still haven't posted it.\n",

    "Our property was listed with an agent; after the contract ran out, we decided to try and sell it on our own. Working with Zillow was an enormously frustrating experience. First, Zillow's site had \"ghost\" information, presumably from the previous MLS listing, although some of the information was incorrect and we could not verify the original source. There were minor errors such as number of days on Zillow, the wrong foundation type, etc; however, the pressing concern was that the Status of the listing was noted as \"P-Pending Sale.\" Assuming that would cost us views/inquiries, we filed error reports; our emails were responded to by technicians telling us that the status error had been corrected--even though it had not been. I tried to contact customer service by phone, but it is fully automated, impossible to get an actual person to talk with you, and no one returned my calls.\n",
    "It took over a month to get the status error corrected, then an even bigger problem occurred when we reduced the selling price and all of our photos disappeared. The reduction was intended to get us more views, but then there was nothing to see. In addition, the Zestimate kept changing, dropping with no explanation and for no apparent reason supported by the local market. Overall, this company is not only infuriating, but incompetent, and, we believe, ultimately detrimental to sellers who use the site.\n",

I had an unpleasant experience working with Steve ** mortgage specialist. His wife Amy asked for all of my documents and then she sent me a good faith estimate. The lender fee was really high, so I told her that I am going to shop around. Also she wanted to charge me to lock the rates but I wanted to wait. Then she insisted I sign the disclosures over and over again until I ran out of patience. This is not a professional behavior. Also she shared my pre-approval letter and information with a realtor she chose for me without consulting me first. Overall they looked pushy and desperate and that did not appeal to me.\n",

The community where 4 of my rentals are located is a very small, moderately upscale, quiet housing development, where neighbors are hyper-aware of strangers lurking, so this was a deal breaker that it turns out I couldn't undo. Deactivate a listing and it's still there, any user can find it. Delete a listing, and it's still there, accessible.

It is a custom home, in one of the best neighborhoods. All the homes were around $210 to $240 per square foot. I took it off the market for a while. We relisted it just a week ago at $765,000 ($203 Sq. Ft.). The values in California are rising from 3% to 6%. My area is rising each month. The homes within 1/4 mile of my home sell for $212 to $253 per square foot. Again, it was showing a Zestimate of around $933,000 for my 3,757 sq. ft. custom home. I agree their estimate is way too high. The house up the street from mine, built the same year, also custom is a little larger and just went pending at $847,000. Having my home listed at $203 per square foot, is below the market value, but I wanted a faster sale. It is in perfect condition with a pool, on almost .23 of an acre. More\n",

    "My home, located in the small town of Humboldt, Iowa, has been listed for sale since February 20. Around the end of March, I looked at my house on Zillow.com and noticed that the price history was incorrect. They have it listed on 3/15 as a rental property with a rent of $148,000/mo. It has never been a rental and the $148,000 is the asking price for my house. Then on 3/17, they have the listing as removed! Before moving to Humboldt 3-1/2 years ago, I actually saw the house I am currently trying to sell listed on Zillow and it was a motivating factor for my move. So I know that people from other areas check out this site to get an idea of the housing market in the area to which they're trying to relocate (I moved to Iowa from North Dakota).

In fact, they don't care about the actual estimates and have absolutely no way of being contacted because they want to hide from the many complaints that they would receive. Competition is on their heels and they will not be in business long as a result. They bought out Trulia but they can't buy every new entry into this arena.

I live in a very hot neighborhood where houses are selling at an extraordinary increase in price from six months ago. There is no reason for the drop and they won't respond to why they reduced the Zestimate. I think they have done so because I was looking at real estate agents and exhibiting \"selling behavior\" which was picked up by their algorithm and arbitrarily reduced - or they are acting in collusion with real estate agents and/or their buyers.

The loan officer told me that his experience was that Zillow overestimates because they count total square footage when an appraisal is done, rather than allocating a far lower value to below ground (even a very nicely finished basement). I told the loan officer that I would therefore be conservative and estimate the value to be closer to $1.8M. I spent $800 on an appraisal, and the value came in at $1.45M. Zillow was so far off (40%!) on the value of my home, and clearly of our entire neighborhood (Cherry Hills Farms in Englewood, Colorado) that I find it irresponsible to reflect values that have no correlation whatsoever to actual value.\n",

    "I tried listing my home for sale by owner and despite repeated efforts and multiple phone calls with their \"customer service\" over two weeks, they cannot do it. However, the home does show up on Zillow as being for sale a long time ago when it was in very poor condition (foreclosure), with terrible pictures and it shows an extremely deflated value. Despite repeated attempts to \"edit\" the home facts and upload pictures after all of the major improvements we made, the old data is all that shows on Zillow. I think they are totally reliant on algorithms and automation and when something is wrong, they don't have the manpower or expertise to correct it.

And those two simple facts alone are what greatly influence the price which a homeowner can reasonable expect to sell their home for. Most persons who do not own a home yet and are in the buying market, are most likely completely unaware of this fact. And therefore they will very likely take the ZEstimate at face value.

    "I have a house which has 3,277 sq ft. On the same community on the same street, you can say in front of my house which has only 2,672 sq ft. The Zestimate of my neighbor is 719,294 and mine is 650,967. The difference of the sq ft is 605 sq ft. Of course mine is bigger. I also did remodeled my 2 bathrooms. So I decided to file a dispute, then I found out that in order to do that I have to go through the agent. This is what this company is doing. The agent has to pay Zillow the advertisement fee. So if you go through the agent they will fix the price for you. I, myself is a real estate appraiser, so I know what this company is doing. This company is a scam. It's not reliable. If you want to know more just go to Zillow.com and click the dispute button then you will find out what I am talking about.\n",

    "At first I was getting lots of actual honest leads. Then things started to slow down - lots of fake telephone numbers, lots unanswered calls, disconnected numbers, people who weren't qualified or clueless. Then the leads just slowed down considerably. They said it was due to the fact that there were more realtors signing on in the area and that more exposure required more money. The Trulia part was supposed to give sellers info which was equally dissatisfying. Then quitting took weeks until I finally destroyed my debit card to make sure they would stop debiting the account.More\n",

How is Zillow still in business? The completely inaccurate zestimate that they post has caused me several sales on my home! Crap homes with no updates have a higher zestimate than mine and when I emailed the company with a list of homes in the same zip code priced much higher the response was staggering. The zestimate is a guide and we encourage all our clients to get a private estimate on their homes. If it's a guide wtf are you posting it? Why not have an option to get this privately if it's just a guide?More\n",

    "Awful service. Not one lead that turned into a sale. They don't answer their phone. Non qualified leads for buyers in three different zip codes. People playing on the computer all hours of the night. A number of lead received through this service. They say \"sorry I hit a wrong button.\" Or \"I'm looking for a family member\" and they will love what I purchase for them. I think not. The last time I checked you would have thought you would get a qualified lead. They never gave me an opportunity to be in the zip codes your actually work in your business. The last rep was very unprofessional and I don't think it's an excuse to justify a service that doesn't work at least in the zip codes I have. I have contacted them but you don't hear from them when you want to cancel. If you throw more money at them they are gladly available to you. IF it's a complaint forget it. They don't even seem amiable to make it right after spending over 7k.\n",

    "I recently signed up with Zillow to begin receiving leads from their website. They stressed that since I had no sales transactions in the last 12 months that it would be very important to get past clients to submit reviews on my profile. They stated it would take about 72 hrs and up to 5 business days to process any reviews submitted. Now, they are telling me it will take up to 10 business days. Meanwhile, I am paying them a fair amount of money and not getting the value I had hoped out of the gate. Classic case of over promising and under delivering.\n",

The clients from this site were very low quality, mostly hangup numbers in the middle of the night, and Zillow said those were good contacts... GOOD GRIEF...
